Downtown,en,"The urban epicenter of commerce and entertainment. The core should be anchored by high-rise structures with ground-level pedestrian engagement opportunities surrounded by mid-rise buildings increasingly offering dense residential uses. Lexington's Downtown should continue to be notable for its mix of uses and variety of transportation options. Parking should be addressed as a shared urban core asset, eliminating dedicated surface parking lots in favor of structures.","recommended_zones: B-2, B-2A, B-2B, MU-2, MU-3",High Density Residential:High Density Non-Residential / Mixed-Use,Downtown.png,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2-uo3P8TRo,/placebuilder/downtown
2nd Tier Urban,en,"Where significant infill and redevelopment opportunities exist in order to complement the urban core, generally situated within the established Infill and Redevelopment Boundary. While not expected to be as intensely developed as the downtown core, high-rise opportunities are not precluded provided that measures are taken to address the adjacent context. The forward trend for development in the 2nd tier urban areas should be towards more walkability, intensity, and appropriate stewardship of the available opportunities that will accommodate Lexington’s future growth, first and foremost.","recommended_zones: B-1, MU-1, MU-2, MU-3, R-4, R-5",Medium Density Residential:Medium-High Density Residential:High Density Residential:Medium Density Non-Residential / Mixed-Use:High Density Non-Residential / Mixed-Use,2nd Tier Urban.png,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRvGc8ir4qM,/placebuilder/2nd-tier-urban
Regional Center,en,"A vibrant hub of commerce, employment, housing opportunities, and entertainment. These are places that include larger buildings with human-scale active ground levels, intentional open spaces and plazas, and walkable transportation networks, all to provide the user/resident with a unique experience. A mix of uses is required to cultivate a sustainable center that is adaptable to future conditions, and they should increasingly include higher-density residential options. They are most often located at the intersection of major roadways and along primary corridors.","recommended_zones: B-6P, B-1, MU-2, MU-3",Medium Density Residential:Medium-High Density Residential:High Density Residential:Medium Density Non-Residential / Mixed-Use:High Density Non-Residential / Mixed-Use,Regional Center.png,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtSa5XJe56c,/placebuilder/regional-center
Corridor,en,"Lexington’s major roadways focused on commerce and transportation. The overriding emphasis of Imagine Lexington is significantly overhauling the intensity of the major corridors. The future of Lexington’s corridors lies in accommodating the shifting retail economic model by incorporating high density residential and offering substantial flexibility to available land uses. Adding a mix of land uses to support the existing retail will provide a built-in customer base, create a more desirable retail experience, and allow a greater return on investment for landholders. Additional focus is on increasing the viability of enhanced mass transit, thereby reducing the reliance on single-occupancy vehicles and improving Lexington’s overall transportation efficiency.","recommended_zones: B-6P, B-1, MU-2, MU-3, R-4, R-5",Low Density Residential:Medium Density Residential:High Density Residential:Medium Density Non-Residential / Mixed-Use:High Density Non-Residential / Mixed-Use,Corridor.png,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B43o_Jq6TCE,/placebuilder/corridor
New Complete Neighborhood,en,"Currently undeveloped areas designed to provide housing within a sustainable format. Including a mix of uses such as neighborhood-serving retail, services, and employment options, as well as larger town centers, will allow citizens to fully realize their day-to-day needs without having to leave their immediate area. Providing a wider variety of housing options rather than large homogeneous sections dedicated to a single type, will ensure that residents of all income levels can afford a home. Intentional greenspaces and neighborhood focal points accessible to all residents should also be provided to add to the sense of place and community. A well-connected multi-modal transportation network is also a key component of a New Complete Neighborhood’s success.","recommended_zones: R-3, R-4, MU-1, MU-2, B-1",Low Density Residential:Medium Density Residential:Medium-High Density Residential:Low Density Non-Residential / Mixed-Use:Medium Density Non-Residential / Mixed-Use,New Complete Neighborhood.png,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ejXPDEBelg,/placebuilder/new-complete-neighborhoods
Enhanced Neighborhood,en,"An existing residential area that could be enhanced with additional amenities, housing types, and neighborhood-serving retail, services, and employment options that contribute to a sustainable neighborhood. Vibrant neighborhoods include a range of uses. The development that occurs in this place-type should be context-sensitive to the surrounding area and implemented in a way that adds to the sense of place. Multi-modal connections from new elements within enhanced neighborhoods are crucial to their success and long-term viability.","recommended_zones: R-3, R-4, MU-1, MU-2, B-1",Low Density Residential:Medium Density Residential:Medium-High Density Residential:Low Density Non-Residential / Mixed-Use,Enhanced Neighborhood.png,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiVo9z9vuKg,/placebuilder/enhanced-neighborhoods
Industry & Production Center,en,Where Lexington’s most intense types of economic development and job creation occur. These places should be located near major corridors to facilitate efficient and affordable shipping and transportation of goods throughout the region while minimizing the impact on the traffic infrastructure throughout the rest of the community.
