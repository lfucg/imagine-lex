Design,en,DS,Theme A - Design Policy 1:Theme A - Design Policy 2:Theme A - Design Policy 3:Theme A - Design Policy 4:Theme A - Design Policy 5:Theme A - Design Policy 6:Theme A - Design Policy 7:Theme A - Design Policy 8:Theme A - Design Policy 9:Theme A - Design Policy 10:Theme A - Design Policy 11:Theme A - Design Policy 12:Theme A - Design Policy 13,Design.png,"As Lexington continues to evolve, it is important to develop in a way that builds community.  Development which may accomplish goals of infill, density, and utilization of underutilized property, but does not meet the other goals of the Comprehensive Plan, is not desirable, and would be a missed opportunity to simultaneously grow and enhance the community.
One of the major shifts in the 2013 Comprehensive Plan was the exclusion of a future land use map for the first time.  While many were concerned, the Planning Commission thought it important to provide flexibility and allow innovative development solutions.  Imagine Lexington further refines the concept and provides additional focus on the policies that will shape proposed developments.  Design plays a large role in this and takes on additional emphasis in this plan.  Ensuring context-sensitive design that follows best practices and provides quality opportunities to enjoy greenspace and open space will create successful neighborhoods."
Density,en,DN,Theme A - Density Policy 1:Theme A - Density Policy 2:Theme A - Density Policy 3:Theme A - Density Policy 4:Theme A - Density Policy 5:Theme A - Density Policy 6,Density.png,"Lexington residents overwhelmingly prefer to maintain the Urban Service Boundary (USB) in its current location, requiring development within the USB to be more compact and efficient as the city grows.  Roughly 90% of the area within the boundary is currently developed, so Lexington must make the most of the remaining 10%, as well as maximize redevelopment efforts.
This more compact development pattern has inherent benefits to the community, beyond simply preserving agricultural land.  It provides for more efficient use of infrastructure, walkable spaces, enhanced transit options, affordable housing opportunities, and numerous environmental benefits.
Infill, which occurs when vacant land is developed within the Boundary, is often met with resistance from adjoining neighborhoods; residents cite traffic, density, and loss of greenspace as some of their reasons for opposition.  While many of the concerns are legitimate, this plan seeks to correct those issues through design."
Equity,en,EQ,Theme A - Equity Policy 1:Theme A - Equity Policy 2:Theme A - Equity Policy 3:Theme A - Equity Policy 4:Theme A - Equity Policy 5:Theme A - Equity Policy 6:Theme A - Equity Policy 7:Theme A - Equity Policy 8,Equity.png,"Equity and equality sound similar, but are different concepts. Equality means sameness, while equity refers to access and opportunity.  To the extent that public policy can eliminate the opportunity gap for Lexington’s underprivileged, it should, acknowledging that the private market does not typically address it unless incentivized or regulated. 
Lexington’s housing policies can and should address displacement caused by the market forces of gentrification. Because regulations are unable to react at the pace of these market forces, efforts are best focused providing housing for everyone, in all areas of the city. Ensuring an adequate supply of units, and more importantly, creating the regulatory framework to allow it, should help alleviate the effects of market-driven gentrification.
Equity policies also address transit, code enforcement, and providing at-risk citizens access to needed services: essential community facilities, age-friendly residential options, and walkable neighborhoods."
Protection,en,PR,Theme B - Protection Policy 1:Theme B - Protection Policy 2:Theme B - Protection Policy 3:Theme B - Protection Policy 4:Theme B - Protection Policy 5:Theme B - Protection Policy 6:Theme B - Protection Policy 7:Theme B - Protection Policy 8:Theme B - Protection Policy 9:Theme B - Protection Policy 10,Protection.png,"The natural environment of Lexington is what we all have in common. It is incumbent upon each to do their part to protect it, and it is crucial that the Comprehensive Plan lay out actionable strategies for safeguarding these valuable resources. As the city continues to grow and develop, it becomes even more important to be cognizant of the effects land use decisions will have on the environment. 

One of the vital components of environmental protection and a historic lynch-pin of the growth management strategy for Lexington is the Urban Service Boundary. There are numerous environmental benefits gained by retaining a compact urban form, and emphasizing the protection of Lexington’s bluegrass landscape continues to be a priority for environmental protections. 

These valuable greenspaces within Lexington should be protected, but, it is also critical to optimize their effectiveness and encourage new and innovative spaces throughout the Urban Service Area. Imagine Lexington makes it clear throughout the plan that safeguarding greenspace for health, social and environmental benefits is paramount to the success and sustainability of the city."
Sustainability,en,SU,Theme B - Sustainability Policy 1:Theme B - Sustainability Policy 2:Theme B - Sustainability Policy 3:Theme B - Sustainability Policy 4:Theme B - Sustainability Policy 5:Theme B - Sustainability Policy 6:Theme B - Sustainability Policy 7:Theme B - Sustainability Policy 8:Theme B - Sustainability Policy 9:Theme B - Sustainability Policy 10:Theme B - Sustainability Policy 11:Theme B - Sustainability Policy 12:Theme B - Sustainability Policy 13,Sustainability.png,"The spirit of sustainability is often captured in the idea of meeting the needs of the present while also supporting the needs of future generations. As Lexington continues to attract more residents, a concerted effort must be made by current residents to be stewards of their natural resources. This also requires strong leadership with foresight to champion good development and to disapprove development patterns that are counter to the city’s long-range vision. Through solid decision-making and a strong policy framework, Lexington can continue to provide for the generations that follow.

Sustainable principles can be applied in a number of ways, from providing a healthy multi-modal transportation network to encouraging the use of green infrastructure principles and environmentally-friendly site design. These methods, along with many others, each represent a small piece of the puzzle when figuring out how to establish the overall success and environmental health of the community, and an intentional strategy is required to ensure future generations can enjoy the fullness of all Lexington has to offer."
Restoration,en,RE,Theme B - Restoration Policy 1:Theme B - Restoration Policy 2:Theme B - Restoration Policy 3:Theme B - Restoration Policy 4,Restoration.png,"“Restoration” is the third pillar strategically, as it should be seen as the last resort. When the first two pillars, “Protection” and “Sustainability” are properly executed, the need to restore the environment should be minimal. However, opportunities exist to restore environmental damage caused by historic development practices and patterns. Measures should be taken to reestablish the environment where degradation has taken place, but must be paired with strong new policies that combat the root of the issues. 
Restoration efforts are characterized by healing and renewal. From an environmental perspective, this can mean planting more trees in canopy-deficient areas, reducing air pollutants through efficient land use patterns and transit options, and mending gaps in our green space network. 
Whether it be for the benefit of the air, water, or land, any efforts to restore or improve the condition of Lexington’s environment is encouraged, but Imagine Lexington prioritizes proactive protection and sustainable development. This policy-driven approach to environmental protection is vastly superior to a reactionary strategy and will benefit all residents, current and future."

Quality of life is synonymous with “livability.” Trends have shown that millennials and young professionals specifically are choosing locations first and then finding employment. Desirable places attract people. The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) has developed a Livability Index for people to measure how livable their community is.  They consider livability through the lenses of housing, neighborhood, transportation, environment, health, engagement, and opportunity, and gauge access to opportunities in each of these categories.  To the extent Lexington is able to improve in these areas, it will be increasingly successful in attracting world-class talent and employers to boost the economy.  "
Diversity,en,DI,Theme C - Diversity Policy 1:Theme C - Diversity Policy 2:Theme C - Diversity Policy 3:Theme C - Diversity Policy 4:Theme C - Diversity Policy 5:Theme C - Diversity Policy 6,Diversity.png,"Diversity in Lexington’s population and workforce affords citizens the opportunity to learn from different viewpoints, experience other cultures, and supplement their weaknesses with others’ strengths. Diversity in an investment portfolio provides safety and security, knowing that, if one investment should falter, the others should be there to be the equalizing force to keep the overall performance meeting expectations.  Similarly, diversity in Lexington’s employment opportunities and industry types offers a resiliency for the community.   The city’s economy is comprised of many parts, and it is incumbent on policy makers and economic development professionals to ensure they pursue all angles.  While it is critical to have large employers that serve as the bedrock on which the economy it is also crucial to prioritize assistance for small businesses. It is key to maintain a diversity in job opportunities while continuing to focus on adding high-paying jobs.  Part of facilitating upward mobility is providing training and educational opportunities."

A multifaceted approach is necessary, because local economies are complex with many moving pieces that each require different levels of attention and specifically tailored solutions. Attracting new businesses in a progressively more competitive market can be aided by federal, state or local incentives. While new business are drawn in, it is important that we also retain existing companies. Developing a highly-skilled workforce in a way that matches college and vocational school students’ curriculum to specific local employment needs would be mutually beneficial for the students, the employers, and the City. Being imaginative and creative with existing land and facilities can take many forms, including adaptive reuse, flexible parking arrangement, shared office space, redevelopment of underutilized property, and infinite other options. This will attract a young and enthusiastic workforce and continue to create a livable city with an interesting, unique, and authentic culture."
Connectivity,en,CO,Theme D - Connectivity Policy 1:Theme D - Connectivity Policy 2:Theme D - Connectivity Policy 3:Theme D - Connectivity Policy 4:Theme D - Connectivity Policy 5:Theme D - Connectivity Policy 6,Connectivity.png,"Imagine Lexington organizes the connectivity pillar around two central ideas: first, that appropriate transportation infrastructure should be dependent upon the intended uses and users; and second, that the design of the public realm include all users and modes of transportation, resulting in the creation of safe, efficient streets. 
For decades, typical street design and development sites have been planned primarily with cars in mind, and little to no thought given to the people using the space. Imagine Lexington hopes to depart from this model and utilize a more multimodal approach, design for all users, and incorporate people-first and “Complete Streets” design. Good street design begets desirable land uses and active, vibrant spaces that add to quality of life. Elements including street trees, landscaping, shade, lighting, building scale and orientation, setbacks, and buffers from traffic contribute to that design quality. 
At the most fundamental level, streets are public rights-of-way, and therefore are public spaces just like parks. They belong to everyone, not just automobile users.

People unquestionably choose to live in the highest quality city they can afford. Therefore, creating quality places and capitalizing on Lexington’s natural and cultural advantages will produce significant economic development gains for the community. Big demographic shifts are driving the need for placemaking, as younger professionals are seeking active urban centers with access to quality transit, while the aging population is looking for easy access to amenities and activities. 
The desired outcomes of the placemaking process are quality public and private spaces where people want to live, work, play, shop, learn, and visit, that complement each other in order to provide opportunities for social interaction. The public should be at the forefront of quality placemaking in their community, with their ideas and vision incorporated into the development plans that will drive implementation by the private sector.

Education, healthcare, public safety, social services, and even the information network are among the facets of a community that can determine its success, long-term viability, and ability to retain and attract citizens. 
Early in its formative years, Lexington has placed a priority on providing a quality education, coined the “Athens of the West” for its progressive culture and educational offerings. As Lexington grows, additional school facilities will be required to educate the 13,000+ new school-aged children expected in the next twenty years. 
Taking care of the most vulnerable populations in Lexington is also a priority, and ensuring the needed social services are easily accessible and available to these citizens is key. Substance abuse and homelessness should be recognized and addressed head-on. 
Another strong support element for Lexington is the healthcare industry, which has continued to see advancements in both the public and private realm. 
Seniors will continue to be the fastest-growing sector of the population with support services for the aging population becoming more critical."
Accountability,en,AC,Theme E - Accountability Policy 1:Theme E - Accountability Policy 2:Theme E - Accountability Policy 3:Theme E - Accountability Policy 4:Theme E - Accountability Policy 5:Theme E - Accountability Policy 6,Accountability.png,"Imagine Lexington is a product of the people of Lexington, and its implementation should reflect the best interests of the citizens it was created by and created for. Ensuring the outlined vision is followed is crucial, and placing safeguards to make that a reality is key to protecting the Plan’s integrity. Imagine Lexington is designed to provide clear expectations for this policy-based plan; if followed, it should result in a livable community that is desirable and forward-thinking. 
This plan distributes the charge of accountability across a collection of interest groups. For citizens, accountability comes in the form of their continued contribution of educated and informed opinions that advise development and plan implementation. For the Division of Planning, accountability is held in the distribution of guidance and information, and doing so in a way that is transparent and accessible for the public.
For developers, accountability comes through with the Placebuilder, which includes criteria for zone change applications to ensure compliance with the Comprehensive Plan. The Placebuilder, paired with intentional and incremental text amendments that set the regulatory boundaries for development, will further reflect the Plan’s overall vision."

This Plan calls for all future development to be sustainable from an economic, environmental, and social standpoint. This means providing for the needs of current citizens without compromising the needs of those in the future. 
Development that is economically sustainable provides patterns that are fiscally responsible with taxpayer dollars and that provide employment opportunities. Environmentally sustainable development is the result of responsible use of the community’s natural and built resources. Lastly, socially sustainable development requires us to ensure opportunities exist for all citizens and to consider the unintended consequences of land use decisions, which is significant for both a local and regional planning efforts. 
Steadfast stewardship of Lexington’s rural landscape through requiring a compact and fiscally responsible growth pattern is another key component of this Plan. There are a number of tools at the community’s disposal to protect agricultural land, while simultaneously enhancing our urban area. Being faithful stewards of this land is one of the most compelling reasons to utilize these tools and employ sound planning principles."

Imagine Lexington has mentioned Lexington’s consistent growth throughout the plan, realizing that many approach this fact with trepidation; however, if proper planning is executed, growth can enhance the community on many levels. 
Building upon the 2013 plan, Imagine Lexington continues the focus on “infill and redevelopment” within the entire Urban Service Area, realizing that the community’s land use policies make all development within the city vitally important to achieving community goals. With infill as a priority, it is also essential to uphold the need for open space. To make the most of urban land, regulations must be modified to reflect the importance of open space and green space for development.
The concept of growth similarly necessitates discussion of the role major corridors play in overall development strategy. This Plan calls for the study of Lexington’s major corridors to identify redevelopment opportunities that will support mass transit initiatives and account for shifts in land uses over time. 
With all of the changes anticipated in the future, the opportunities for Lexington are immense. Preemptive planning through Imagine Lexington’s vision will continue the city along a path that builds on the past, but also embraces the future."
