Mass transit infrastructure should be considered essential. Proposed developments on current transit lines or future expected routes should enhance existing infrastructure to accommodate the new or increased ridership. Shelters and seating options should be scaled, added or improved accordingly. Development should provide direct pedestrian and bicycle linkages to transit. Pedestrian infrastructure should include wide sidewalks on both sides of streets and separated bike lanes wherever possible. Further, a people-first design should ensure that pedestrian and bicycle users’ safety is assured by the incorporation of traffic calming measures that slows traffic and increases driver awareness.",,Off

However, it is important to note that there are many benefits to the increased connectivity that further the health, safety, and welfare of the community.

“Providing a strong connected network of roads and pedestrian facilities can help distribute traffic, reduce travel distances and times, improve routing for transit and reduce walking distances. Good connectivity also provides better routing opportunities for emergency and delivery (solid waste, recycling, mail) vehicles. All of these effects can play a positive role in reducing congestion on the street network.” - Kentucky Transportation Cabinet

It enhances the existing neighborhoods through land uses and development patterns that are sensitive to the nearby built and natural environments.  This does not mean all developments should be homogeneous or that Lexington should continue its history of highly separated land uses and residential densities, but rather new development should be connected to existing neighborhoods in a meaningful way that brings a higher quality of life to all residents by creating a sense of place. These connections can be made through providing complementary uses (neighborhood-serving retail, places of employment, community greenspaces and open areas, and other neighborhood focal points), as well as physical multimodal connections.  The connection of uses should be done through an appropriate scale that makes them accessible and not out of place or intrusive.

Theme A - Design Policy 5,5,Provide pedestrian friendly street patterns and walkable blocks to create inviting streetscapes.,en,"topic: Transportation, Health, Quality of Life",A3:B2:D1:D2,A1a:A1c:A3b:A4a:B2d:C2d:D1a:D1b:E1b,Pedestrian Friendly,"Street design matters.  Creating a neighborhood environment that is not only able to be walked, but is actually inviting and walkable is vital to providing a safe way for people to move from place to place.  When designing the street facilities, developers should, “consider how to keep people walking separate from people driving vehicles; keep traffic speeds low; ensure sidewalks and curb ramps are accessible to people with disabilities; and clarify where each road user should be expected to travel” (Dangerous by Design, 2016).

Traffic speeds dramatically affect a pedestrian’s actual and perceived sense of safety, as well as the quality of life in neighborhoods. Likewise, speeding is a common concern for residents. The same 2016 publication above reported that pedestrians struck by a motor vehicle traveling at 40 miles per hour are fatally injured 65 percent of the time. Speeds at 30 mph reduce the risk of death to 18 percent. Only 6 percent of pedestrians struck by vehicles traveling at 20 mph are fatally injured. It is important, therefore, to reduce vehicle speeds in high pedestrian activity areas, such as neighborhoods, commercial areas, schools and parks.

Vehicle speeds are heavily influenced by roadway design, regardless of the posted speed limit. Narrow, curvilinear streets with on-street parking and street trees help to slow traffic and create a pedestrian-friendly atmosphere. Residential streets that are overly wide and straight and lack a vertical edge, such as trees or buildings, enable fast-moving traffic.  It is also important to consider land uses and their relationship to the streets within the neighborhood.  Thoughtful attention should be given to ensuring there is a people-first building orientation, and pedestrian-oriented uses activating the ground level.  

Placemaking and walkability are important to the success of Lexington and its neighborhoods. A variety of best-practice reviews show that property values tend to be higher in more walkable neighborhoods that contain a mix of nearby destinations connected by pedestrian-friendly streets.  Additionally, research shows that this type of development is particularly desirable for the senior and young professional-aged populations that comprise the majority of Lexington’s future growth.

This can be achieved by placing parking lots to the rear or interior of the site, so that the building fronts along a public street. This increases the structure’s visual aesthetic, the walkability of the development, and allows for better integration into the existing pattern of the area. For areas where this is not feasible, screening and buffering with trees and shrubs can soften the impact of parking areas on adjacent properties.

It has the benefits of improving air quality, providing social interactions, and improving public health. An interconnected and accessible greenspace system consisting of vibrant and attractive public spaces, healthy natural areas and plentiful recreational opportunities create neighborhoods where people want to live. 

Over the years, greenspace has evolved far beyond the definition of rural landscapes. Greenspace encompasses public parks, trails, boulevards, activity lawns, schoolyards, public plazas, amphitheaters, stormwater basins, the arboretum, cemeteries, etc. Based on the input from the Greenspace Survey in 2016, people have a strong desire for accessible greenspace. People have a preference to reside close to greenspace that they are able to walk to. 
Since 2007, when green infrastructure was introduced in the Comprehensive Plan, it has continued to play a strong role in protecting Lexington’s cultural landscape and urban forms. At the same time, it was a sustainable tool for stormwater management, and was incorporated into the Stormwater Manual as a requirement in 2016. Nevertheless, green infrastructure has become an important part of the greenspace system.

Regional parks such as Masterson Station and the Kentucky Horse Park have big venues, functional for large events, while people also desire neighborhood pocket parks where they can enjoy and gather on a regular basis. As shown from Your Parks Our Future city survey by LFUCG Parks and Recreation, the recreational greenspace opportunities that made the priority list are walking and hiking trails, natural areas/nature parks, small neighborhood parks, paved bike trails and indoor swimming pools. Successful neighborhoods such as Gratz Park, Bell Court, Woodland Park, Ashland Park and Downtown are all recognized by their accessible greenspace, inevitably contributing to the overall Bluegrass identity. Indicative of Lexington’s roots, settlement patterns for these older neighborhoods are characterized by narrower interconnected streets and sidewalks, with structures oriented toward the street or park, which create a vibrant relationship with the public domain. 

In the ongoing Your Parks Our Future, Parks is planning to take a systematic approach and meet ambitious goals. The Strategic Plan recommends an increase in the population served within a ten-minute walk of a Neighborhood Park (or larger) from the current 40% to 65%, and to increase the population served within a five-minute drive of a Community Park (or larger) from the current 70% to 85%, through development of existing parkland and new parks in growing areas.

Providing opportunities to increase residential density and professional/commercial intensity that could spur economic investment is an important step that the Government could take, using that opportunity to re-establish a new or better community focal point.

This reduces response times for emergency vehicles and improves access and efficiency for transit, school buses, and service vehicles, including solid waste trucks and street sweepers. Creating a robust street system with multiple routes to neighborhood destinations is unquestionably a best planning practice. Dispersing the traffic of an entire area onto multiple collector and local streets makes every street in a neighborhood desirable, and none too overburdened.

Stub streets are closed-end streets that do not contribute to the critical connectivity described above. Stub streets are similar to cul-de-sacs except that they provide no turnaround circle at their closed end, and they are only acceptable as a temporary street condition. Planning staff will undertake additional revisions to the subdivision regulations to require signage at all stub streets to alert neighborhood residents that future roadway connections will be made, and how they may discuss the timing and impacts with staff.",,Off

However, high density development is not appropriate in every context.  As stressed within the “Design” vision and policies, density should address the context of its surroundings.   

Imagine Lexington intends to direct the highest density/intensity development to the major corridors and downtown area to bolster the viability of an enhanced transit service.  Doing so also ensures that the bulk of the highest density residential development occurs outside of existing thriving neighborhoods.

Incorporating more of these uses into existing neighborhoods as well as new developments should be encouraged.  Not all commercial development proposals near residential neighborhoods should be considered supportive, but those that also respond to the “Design” and “Equity” policies, and provide a clear neighborhood need, can be.  Additionally, commercial development near residential neighborhoods should not be rejected because it might generate activity near that neighborhood.  Vibrant neighborhoods include a range of uses.
Previous efforts to grow neighborhood-scale commercial areas came at a time when traditional anchor retailers were continually closing smaller stores to concentrate their efforts on larger big-box style footprints in higher traffic areas.  Competition among retailers nationally meant that scale was the driving factor, and neighborhood business zones were no longer suitable for their needs.  The loss of anchor tenants reduced the overall viability of the commercial spaces.  Given the shifting nature of retail in an e-commerce era, businesses must re-imagine the way they are meeting the needs of the neighborhood. 

Today’s successful neighborhood commercial has a much stronger sense of place, where residents of the area prioritize convenience over cost.  Restaurants, personal services, and boutique shopping with integrated community social spaces are the hallmarks of successful small-scale commercial areas like Romany Road and the ever-evolving Southland Drive.  Redevelopment of existing commercial centers should focus primarily on creating a space for people to spend time, and smaller spaces for people to shop and work.

As Lexington continues to grow, ADUs can play a role in meeting the overall housing demand.

ADUs are not a new idea, and examples of them can be found throughout the United States. Old alley apartments in DC, or carriage houses in fine old Seattle homes, have been around for a long time, but they fell out of favor in the middle of the 20th century.  Now they are an increasingly popular and important housing option in urbanizing cities today. Where Lexington has traditionally had a significant portion of its development controlled by a handful of developer/builders, ADUs essentially create a whole new market (a ‘cottage’ industry, if you will) for small builders to construct a housing product the community needs. There is tremendous opportunity to enhance existing neighborhoods by building new context sensitive ADUs. In areas where property values have increased dramatically and tear-down/rebuilds have started to shift the appearance of the neighborhood, the creation of an accessory dwelling unit could make retention of an existing principal structure more economically viable.

The 2017 Housing Demand Study shows that single-family residential options continue to be popular and will be for the foreseeable future.  However, the paradigm for providing these single-family homes is shifting from the larger suburban model lots to a more compact and urban form of single-family home, such as town-homes, fourplexes, and others.

One way to provide for this type of development would be amending the regulations to allow group residential developments that include single-family housing.  This compact type of development allows for shared common space and reduced maintenance, which are ideal for the senior and young-professional aged populations.

Louisville, Covington, and Erlanger have all taken this proactive approach to this serious issue.

The goal of this approach is to identify problem properties and utilize random inspections to keep landlords from delaying maintenance or poorly managing their units.  Cities both large and small across the country use rental registration programs and their tangible successes are well documented.  As Lexington moves towards becoming a larger metropolitan city, it is incumbent upon the government to ensure all residents are afforded the opportunity to live in safe, code compliant homes.  A comprehensive, equitable housing policy must address existing housing as well as new construction.

There are additional benefits on the landlord/property owner side as well.  In preliminary meetings with housing stakeholders, developers with a proven track record of strong property management indicated that the most important factor in their decision to make a purchase in a given area was the upkeep and maintenance of that neighborhood by other landlords.  They felt it was impossible to overcome the inertia of neighborhood decline without other good faith actors.  A proactive approach to code enforcement, driven by random inspections, will ensure that it is possible to invest in all areas where a return can be achieved by making all neighborhoods more desirable.

There are two treatment plants capable of treating over 60 million gallons of sewage each day. Since entering into the consent decree with EPA in 2011, the division continues to monitor the water impact of new development, and has been incorporated into the development plan review process with a required sign-off. The Government’s challenge is to provide capacity when a proposed new development or redevelopment is considered to be in the best interest of the community. The Consent Decree also requires that a Remedial Measures Program is established for the Lexington-Fayette Urban County sanitary sewer system. This program will evaluate the sanitary sewer system to identify a cost-effective, efficient improvement plan to address recurring sanitary sewer overflows. Further control is recommended to notify and communicate with CAP capacity when a conditional use or change of use is proposed, as well as at the time of a preliminary zone change. The process should be documented in zoning compliance letters.
 
The Stormwater Quality Projects Incentive Grant Program provides financial assistance for projects that improve water quality, reduce stormwater runoff and educate citizens about stormwater and water quality issues in our community. There are three types of grants, including infrastructure, education and neighborhood. Since 2011, the Division of Water Quality has managed the grant awards totaling between $1.2 and $1.7 million each year. Application to the grant is encouraged and should be promoted through community outreach and the development process.

Linking greenways, tree protection areas, stream corridors, stream conservation greenways, and/or significant tree canopies allows wildlife and flora to travel and thrive in a more ecologically diverse environment in both the Rural Service Area and the Urban Service Area, where feasible.  Seeing flora (plant life) and fauna (animals) are good for reducing stress, and ecological diversity plays a part in providing places where bees can feed.  As of August 2017, Lexington has 28,953 acres of Rural Service Area farmland conserved with PDR easements.  The purpose of the PDR easements is to preserve farmland and environmentally sensitive land in the Rural Service Area.  The farmland preserved provides food security for Lexington and surrounding areas, since the valuable agricultural soil is protected from development.  If land is preserved for farming but bee populations are not sufficient to pollinate plants, then production of food could be very limited.  Therefore, safe places for bees is another reason for protecting natural habitats and flora.  In 1999, the Land Capability Analysis defined the boundaries of environmentally sensitive areas, which equaled about 30% of the Rural Service Area.   

The Natural Area (NAT) identified on page 51 of the 2017 Rural Land Management Plan, contains about 8,500 acres and is located in the extreme southeastern part of the county.  It includes floodplains, riparian vegetation, steep slopes, and canopy coverage, and is home to a wide variety of aquatic and wildlife.  Agriculture does occur in portions of the NAT.  Echoing the 2017 Rural Land Management Plan, “…the preservation and enhancement of the land, vegetation and water in a natural state with a minimum of intrusions” is a policy emphasized.

The Rural Land Management Plan lists “Special Natural Protection Areas”, which are located all over the RSA, not just in the NAT.  The lists describe mapped areas of high priority and slightly lower priority for preservation, and include sites with rare species of plants, large blue ash trees, rare bird sites, river slopes, and natural bodies of water. The Rural Land Management Plan identified special natural protection areas; the “A” sites are those with the highest priority for preservation, and the “B” sites are those with a slightly lower priority for preservation.

For development applications inside the USA, a process should be established to identify and quantify endangered species on a proposed development site. New developments are suggested to avoid dividing floodplains into private ownership with flood insurance. Care should be taken during the development process to provide additional protection areas around floodplains and to incorporate them into accessible greenspace. Single-loaded streets could provide more open accessibility to the residents in the vicinity, and are recommended to be utilized.",Develop an inventory of Special Natural Protection Areas within the Urban Service Area.,On

In 1958, the Urban Service Area Boundary was created to manage development, and has become a pioneering landmark for planning across the nation. In 2000, the Purchase of Development Rights Ordinance was adopted. 

As of August 25, 2017, there were 28,953 acres of farmland in Fayette County preserved in perpetuity by PDR, and another 1,257 acres under contract.  There are 261 farms permanently protected by PDR.  The goal of the PDR program is to conserve 50,000 acres of land.

In comparison, Kentucky’s farm operations made up 51.6% of the state’s total land area, and U.S. farm operations made up 40.5% of total land area in the country. The percentage of total farm acres used for cropland is 35.1%; the remaining acreage is mostly horse farms.
The 2017 Rural Land Management Plan listed 90,774 acres in 1,080 parcels in Agricultural Use in the Rural Service Area, and the Fayette County PVA assessed 1,736 properties in the Rural Service Area as agriculture or “farms.” A report named “Rural Land Use Inventory, Fayette County, Kentucky,” June 2017 by Lynn Roche Phillips, PhD., AICP, and Priyanka Ghosh, PhD., University of Kentucky, Department of Geography, indicates that 108,248 acres of Fayette’s Rural Service Area is used for agriculture. The 2012 Ag Census, which combined the Urban Service Area and Rural Service Areas, reports 718 farms covering 114,857 acres. The farms within the USA are expected to develop eventually.
In 2007, the Ag Census reported that there were 810 farms and 135,969 acres in farms.  The 2017 Ag Census results will be released in 2019, and will be informative regarding the acreage of agricultural use by farm type and changes in agricultural land use between 2012 and 2017.

The development of farms within the USA, such as The Summit at Fritz Farm development at the corner of Man O’ War Boulevard and Nicholasville Road, may account for some small portion of this decrease in farms between the 2007 and 2012 Ag Censuses. The Summit at Fritz Farm was formerly the Fritz farm for decades; however, this farm was located inside the Urban Service Area, with high visibility, at one of the busiest intersections (according to trip generation data) in Lexington. The Summit at Fritz Farm is a good example of promoting the food chain network in Lexington. It has one of the five locations of the Lexington Farmers Market, a Whole Foods store with locally grown produce and meat available for sale, and locally owned restaurants featuring locally grown produce and meat. 

While equine operations are the dominant farm type in Fayette County, the 2017 Rural Land Use Inventory by Phillips and Ghosh cited above found that there were numerous farm operations that were non-equine related or mixed with equine: 31,424 acres “general agriculture,” 11,898 acres “general agriculture and cattle,” and 27,027 acres “equine farm and general agriculture.” The Kentucky Department of Agriculture Business Directory includes Fayette County farms that are raising goats, free range chickens, eggs, sheep, cattle, grass-fed beef, vegetables, fruit, and vineyards, and other non-food products related such as landscaping plant materials. 
The Bluegrass Stockyards’ Lexington location, named the Blue Grass Regional Marketplace, is one of seven live sale locations in their entire Bluegrass Stockyards network, and is a significant contributor to Lexington’s local food chain network. The Lexington market handles $200-$250 million in business annually, selling 100,000-125,000 heads of cattle a year. It accounts for more than any of their other six locations in the region, with a total of about 500,000 heads of cattle sold annually. The Blue Grass Regional Marketplace not only sells cattle; it also has: a farmers market on Saturdays; a restaurant; a butcher counter selling locally sourced beef, pork, lamb, and more; retail stores selling farrier supplies; outfitters; bourbon and horse country items; meeting, event, and classroom spaces; and a museum and learning center. 

There are a number of other efforts in promoting locally grown food:  Farm to School programs, Food Chain, SeedLeaf, Field to Table dinner, and CSA Farm to table. Ashton Wright, Ph.D, Lexington’s Local Food Coordinator, reported that there are at least eight farms offering CSAs in Fayette, and that Lexington has five farmers markets and two Fresh Stop markets. Of the 47 vendors in the Lexington Farmers Market, nine are Fayette County businesses, making products such as cheese, pasta, olive oils, kettle corn, etc. and three of the Fayette County vendors sell produce: sweetcorn, honey, vegetables, and shrimp.

Supporting the local food system has important implications for consumers, farmers, food-related businesses and entrepreneurs, and the community as a whole.

Environmental Benefits include (Reference: http://www.cmap.illinois.gov/livability/local-food/about):

• Farmland is an important economic asset. As cities develop, they often infringe upon and fragment farmland. Therefore, it is important to preserve productive farmland to maintain the integrity of Lexington’s unique rural landscape and identity and support agricultural productivity as an important piece of the local economy.

• Purchasing food grown locally reduces food miles-the distance food travels from the farm to your table- and has a positive impact on the environment. The average food item travels 1,500 miles, compared to the average locally-produced item, which travels only 56 miles.

• Supporting local food systems can help reduce waste. Approximately 41 percent of U.S. food waste goes to landfills. Instead of taking up space in the landfill, the valuable nutrients in wasted food could be composted and used for a variety of purposes, including local food production.

Year after year, visitors surveyed by VisitLEX say that they come to the Bluegrass for the horses, landscape and bourbon. The two major attractions, which draw more than a million visitors a year to the Rural Service Area, are the Kentucky Horse Park and Keeneland. There are numerous for-profit tour companies and Horse Country, a non-profit coalition of farms that provide visitors from all over the world with access to these destinations. As of July 2017, Horse Country had 35 member farms, clinics and a feed mill participating, with 24 of them offering tours, and in the first two years, there have been over 80,000 visitors. The community now has the opportunity to enjoy an authentic experience with horses, which further allows them to promote Lexington as a regional attraction. 

In 2016, a text amendment was approved to allow agritourism and ecotourism as a conditional use in the Rural Service Area. Agritourism activities allowed in the A-R and A-N zones include corn mazes, farm gift shops, educational classes related to agricultural products or skills, horse shows involving more than 70 participants and seasonal activities. For A-B zones, children’s rides are also listed. Other agritourism and equine-related activities, such as wineries, hayrides, petting zoos, youth camps, and bed and breakfast establishments were already principal, accessory or conditional uses in the agricultural zones (KRS 100). Racetracks and historic house museums are allowed as conditional uses in the A-R zone. 
Ecotourism allowed in the A-R zone includes equine trails, botanical gardens and nature preserves. In the A-B and A-N zones, ecotourism includes commercial hiking and bicycling trails, equine trails, tree canopy tours, canoing and kayaking launch sites, botanical gardens, nature preserves and recreational outfitters limited to equipment rental only.

The Urban Service Area concept uses land wisely for development while protecting valuable soils and farms in the Rural Service Area.  When feasible and appropriate, the community should work to protect the natural habitats and trees within the USA; not only for the enjoyment of the people experiencing them, but for environmental and economical sustainability reasons.  Conserving these habitats and trees in developments in the USA land reduces the heat island effect, as well as protecting rare and endangered species of trees and other flora and wildlife for diversity.  
 
Providing connections to other greenways, tree stands, and stream corridors increases the linear ecological network, providing wildlife corridors and a diverse ecosystem.  When trees are planted as part of development, grouping trees helps create microclimates, which increases the survivability of the trees.  Trees play not only an environmental role, but also an economical one; they are assets to the community, as they capture stormwater run-off and reduce energy costs of cooling and heating buildings.   
 
Preserving trees can prove difficult, however, since 84% of the USA land is in private ownership.  Public education is important to get the word out to property owners about how valuable their trees are and how to ensure their proper care.   In 2012, the Davey Resource Group performed an assessment of Lexington’s urban tree canopy using aerial photographic data.  This assessment showed that Lexington’s urban tree canopy coverage was 24.6%.  In addition, the Davey Resource Group reported the data by council district and by watershed, and gave guidance on actions that need to be taken to preserve and increase our tree canopy.

Protecting our remaining greenspace is not a luxury; it is a necessity for maintaining the quality of life that Bluegrass residents have always enjoyed and will continue to desire for the future.

Greenspace is more than horse farms, parks, and rock fences; it also encompasses natural environments such as streams, sinkholes, and the Kentucky River, valuable resources such prime soils; buildings that recall the community’s founding and history; the experience of the city or countryside from an automobile; and the ability to travel safely by bicycle or on foot.

Vehicles (or mobile sources) are a significant contributor to urban air pollution. Technology (cleaner vehicles and cleaner fuels) will continue to reduce vehicle pollution, but more people living in an area generally equates to more vehicles on the road. Recent national trends show a decrease in personal vehicle miles of travel per person, and it is likely that this trend will continue. However, the population is also increasing, and the economy is entering a period of growth. Thus, it is anticipated that overall travel demand will continue to grow. If the community does not meet this increased demand in an efficient and multimodal manner, additional congestion may ensue, potentially compromising air quality.
 
From the public input analysis of the Lexington Area Bicycle & Pedestrian Master Plan in 2017, results show more than 60% of Lexington residents are interested in biking, but are concerned about using bicycles in the urban area. People report that biking seems difficult and dangerous, due to driver behaviors such as speeding, inattention, failure to yield at intersections, etc. Most people think biking is important for transportation and recreation, and they praised projects like Legacy Trail and the Town Branch Trail.

Mass transit options should be competitive in terms of economic value, comfort level and time consumption. Transit parking facilities, development within walking distance and pedestrian accessibility to transit stops are some of the tools to encourage people to take advantage of the mass transit option for commuting.

Regional commuting tools have great potential to expand those options, and additional organizations to collaborate on regional commuting should be explored. Lexington is a major employment hub for the Bluegrass area. In estimates from 2015 census data, 49.5% of Lexington workers live outside of Fayette county and commute into Lexington every day, while 50.5% are employed and living in Lexington-Fayette County. Commutes into and out of Fayette County primarily take place along the major arterials leading into and out of Lexington. As population and employment growth continues into the future, these major arterials will continue to serve these commuting patterns at the regional level. Recent data shows Lexington workers still rely highly on single-occupant vehicle driving. The infrastructure for multimodal commuting is in the MPO plan of the 2040 Metropolitan Transportation Plan.
 
Developers and employers should explore options to provide priority parking spaces for car-share vehicles, design for safe and easy ingress/egress during peak hours, and provide shuttles for residents to and from transit stops.

This type of development allows people to choose the best option for each trip: walking and cycling for local errands, convenient and comfortable public transit for travel along major urban corridors, and automobile travel to more dispersed destinations. People who live and work in such communities tend to own fewer vehicles, drive less, and rely more on alternative modes.
TOD provides multiple health and environment benefits:

Reduce congestion & vehicle-related emission: 30-50% reductions in per capita annual congestion delay are typical between transit-oriented cities and comparable size automobile-oriented cities.

Reduce impervious surface occupied for roadway & parking facilities:
 TOD improves stormwater infiltration in a natural setting, rather than via engineering methods. Ultimately, it will also save the cost on roadway / parking infrastructure.
 
Conserve energy & reduce energy-generating emission: 
Residents of transit-oriented communities tend to consume 20-40% less transportation energy than they would in more automobile-dependent communities.

Strengthen transit system: Neighborhood patterns and transportation go hand in hand. TOD with well-designed land use and alternative infrastructure will encourage residents to use mass transit and stabilize transit ridership, thus reducing transportation cost to families and to the environment.

Support healthy lifestyles
Transit users are four times as likely to achieve the target of 20 minutes or more of walking per day, as opposed to people who do not use transit on a particular day.

Improve safety: 
Residents of transit-oriented communities have about a quarter of the per-capita traffic fatality rate compared to residents of automobile-dependent sprawl, taking into account all traffic deaths, including pedestrians and transit passengers.

There are also more benefits of TOD in neighborhood, community and economics aspects, which will be explored in the related themes of imagine Lexington.

Energy efficiency criteria is used to guide purchasing decisions in new buildings, repairs and retrofits. Account-by-account rate analysis has identified less expensive options for many utility accounts, saving taxpayer dollars. To complement these efforts, LFUCG has established the Energy Improvement Fund – an internal revolving loan program that allows utility savings from energy management activities to be applied to future projects.

A community-led voluntary plan, Empower Lexington, was put into action by the Urban County Council in 2012 via resolution #0439-12 which approved the plan and allowed implementation of its recommendations. The responsibilities for implementation of the varied recommendations are sometimes with the local government as the lead agency, while other times a non-profit assumes the responsibility, and is sometimes implemented by public/private partnerships.

More recognition and awards programs can be explored, such as green neighborhood awards, green business operation pilot programs, etc.

The Lexington-Fayette Urban County Council approved legislation in the spring of 2018 to create a county-wide Energy Project Assessment District (EPAD) for commercial, non-profit, multi-family, agricultural, and industrial property owners to acquire special financing called PACE (Property Assessed Clean Energy) financing, for improvements and upgrades resulting in energy-efficiency.  EPADs were created by legislation passed by the Kentucky General Assembly in 2015, allowing local governments to create EPADs.  The PACE financing may be used for 100% of the energy upgrades, both hard and soft costs, such as solar panels, energy efficient air conditioning and heating, water conservation, and LED lighting.  The PACE loan is repaid through voluntary assessment on the property owner’s tax bill, requires no down payment, and it is a long term loan with a fixed-rate.

• Conserving natural resources such as timber, water and minerals
• Increasing economic security by tapping a domestic source of materials
• Preventing pollution by reducing the need to collect new raw materials
• Saving energy
• Supporting American manufacturing and conserves valuable resources

Lexington is serviced both by a municipal waste management program, as well as private haulers.  The City of Lexington has a fully functioning municipal recycling facility (MRF) to sort recycled waste and separate it with machines, compared to some adjacent counties. The City also holds many special events throughout the year to assist citizens in waste disposal and other needs, such as household hazardous waste, paper shredding, the “Gobble Grease Toss” and mulch giveaways. Lexington also has a composting program for residential yard waste. Such events promote community engagement and education in addition to their environmental benefits.  These programs should be continued and expanded.

Effective waste management is equally as important to keep the Bluegrass beautiful as building attractive neighborhoods, and builds quality of life while improving the health and the appearance of the community.

The Partnership for a Green City represents a collaborative effort to improve sustainability internally and in the community by four of Louisville’s largest public entities, including Louisville Metro Government, University of Louisville, Jefferson County Public Schools and Jefferson Community & Technical College. The partnership, which began in 2004, employs over 30,000 people; enrolls over 135,000 students; owns more than 531 buildings with 30 million square feet of space; operates and maintains 7,000 fleet vehicles; and manages 25,135 acres of land in Louisville Metro, which is one-tenth of the land in the merged city-county. To the north of Lexington in Cincinnati, OH, the Green Umbrella is the leading alliance that facilitates collaboration among over 200 area non-profits, businesses, educational institutions and governmental entities focused on the environmental aspects of sustainability for the Greater Cincinnati area. 

Based on these models, Bluegrass Forever Green, under Bluegrass Tomorrow, shares information and best practices while focusing on maximizing the collective impact of regional governments, organizations, non-profits, educational institutions and businesses in central Kentucky dedicated to environmental sustainability and improving quality of life and economic development in the Bluegrass. Bluegrass Forever Green focuses on local foods, clean water, energy, outdoor recreation and green spaces, waste, and recycling and transportation. Its mission is to further the goals of Bluegrass Tomorrow, a coalition of business, education, farming, development, and preservation interests dedicated to developing a regional unified vision.  They focus on education, land use, job growth, and quality of life innovations, which leads to an environment that develops creative talent and where young professionals and entrepreneurship thrive.

The summit of Bluegrass Forever Green Sustainability Partnership was introduced in 2015, in collaboration with Bluegrass Greensource, and continues to sustain Bluegrass Forever with conservation, preservation and sustainability initiatives. Through the summit discussion, consensus was reached that the partnership would move forward with working teams focusing on: 1) Land, which includes the Equine Agriculture Initiative, visioning for the community’s next great land preservation program, and the National Park Service Rivers Trails Conservation Assistance Program, which plans for trails and greenways; 2) Water, including work with the Kentucky River Water Trails Alliance and River Blast Events; 3)Waste and recycling; 4) Energy; and 5) Local food and agriculture. The most recent summit on local food was held in December 2017, and the Regional Food Council Initiative was formed to help expand local food in the Bluegrass Region.
 
Lexington has strong programs focused on sustainability across the community, with Fayette County Public Schools, University of Kentucky, LFUCG Environmental Services and the Mayor’s office. Collaboration needs to be expanded as the programs continue to grow. Through the coordination of efforts and cooperation, a partnership between the largest stakeholders could realize real results that will have a long-term impact on the health, education, and well-being of Lexington citizens. 

Responsibility to manage and maintain sustainable programs should be clarified. HOAs should be established to plant and maintain a lush landscape, which can help create a consistent and welcoming community.

A tree’s shade and beauty contributes to the community’s health and softens the often hard appearance of urban landscapes and streetscapes. When properly maintained, trees provide abundant environmental, economic, and social benefits to a community, far in excess of the time and money invested in their planting, pruning, protection, and removal.

Lexington’s Urban Forestry Management Plan has a statement of, “achieving a sustainable urban forest in Lexington.” This mission encompasses the broad issues concerning the health and vitality of urban forests. A canopy made up of trees that are native, hardy, diverse, and compatible with conditions and climate, properly planted and maintained and protected, makes for a healthy, long-lived, and thus sustainable urban forest, with all of its benefits. For example, studies suggest that tree-lined streets are safer, with reduced traffic speeds and reduced driver stress (from 2013 Urban Tree Canopy Assessment and Planting Plan, by Davey Resource Group).Trees have also been proven to increase residential property values 3-7% when present in the yard, and 9% when adjacent as street trees. Additionally, consumers have been found to spend more time and have a more favorable view of businesses when the business district has a vibrant landscaping plan with many trees.

Lexington’s zoning ordinance has established standards for Commercial Landscaping (Article 18) and Tree Protection (Article  26). These ordinances set minimum tree canopy coverage standards for commercial and residential zones.  Steps to review and update these ordinances are part of the Urban Forestry Management Plan, and are reinforced in Imagine Lexington.
 
In Lexington, 16% of all land is publicly owned, and 84% is privately owned, according to the 2013 Urban Tree Canopy Assessment. In order to “achieve a sustainable urban forest in Lexington”, it is therefore important to engage both the public and the private sectors in the stewardship of the urban forest. This requires mechanisms for educating and encouraging private sector engagement in urban forestry. Updating tree inventory on a continuous basis, and supplementing with a comprehensive urban tree canopy assessment every 10 years, along with tracking all completed action items, will provide opportunity for evaluation and adjustments.

Tree protection is required in the development process. Contacting the urban forester is required by the ordinances and the procedures manual. The benefits associated with the conservation of trees, tree stands, and greenspaces as a part of new development planning is well documented. According to the 2016 Greenspace Survey, 92% of respondents feel developers should be responsible for greenspace creation as basic infrastructure, while 78% feel that there should be additional protection for trees of significant species, size and condition. 
LFUCG currently has initiatives to increase public participation in care and planting of trees on public property through Reforest the Bluegrass. Grassroots non-profit organization Trees Lexington! has also gained tremendous momentum in the community, and has been advocating for increased urban tree canopy. Lexington has established a well-stocked plant nursery at Hisle Park, where trees, shrubs, and other plants will be grown and propagated for installation on public properties, including parks, greenways, and facilities. It is time to move trees forward on the budget list.",Implement recommendations from the Urban Forestry Management Plan.,Off

The 2004 Greenway Master Plan identified several conservation greenways in the county which are a crucial component of the greenspace network within our region.

Seedleaf was founded in 2007 with a mission to nourish communities by growing and sharing food in Lexington. The nonprofit grew three gardens in 2008, 10 gardens in 2009, and has grown steadily since then. While neighbors come together to produce local food and improve social connections, the process also restores natural resources within the urban area, leaving ecological benefits for the environment. Seedleaf cultivates 15 free u-pick community gardens throughout Fayette County’s food deserts, areas deemed by the USDA to have problematic access to fresh local food. Seedleaf also picks up compost at 35 area restaurants and kitchens through their Compost Partners Program, a partnership with the Lexington Fayette Urban County Government’s Division of Waste Management. Much of that food waste is composted at or near community gardens.
 
Urban farming has become popular in multiple cities. With growing population and urbanization, suitable agricultural soil is diminishing within the urban area. However, market demand for organic locally grown food is dramatically increasing for health and economic reasons. New solutions are popping up, including rooftop farming. Lexington has a community base for organic locally grown agriculture, in which new development could play a major role.

“Soaring prices and concerns about chemical-laden fruits and vegetables increasingly drive us to grow our own healthy food close to home. In cities, however, vanishing ground space and contaminated soils spur farmers, activists, and restaurateurs to look to the skyline for a solution. The hunger for local food has reached new heights, and rooftops can provide the space that cities need to bring fresh, organic produce to tables across North America.”

Vehicles (or mobile sources) are a major contributor to urban air pollution. Technology (cleaner vehicles and cleaner fuels) will continue to reduce vehicle pollution, but more people living in an area generally equates to more vehicles on the road. Recent national trends show a decrease in personal vehicle miles of travel per person and it is likely that this trend will continue. However, the population is also increasing and the economy is entering a period of growth. Thus, it is anticipated that overall travel demand will continue to grow. If demand is not met in an efficient and multimodal manner, additional congestion may ensue, potentially compromising air quality.

Lexington is a relatively vehicle-dependent city and some damage to air quality has already taken place. The Lexington Area MPO monitors local air quality and promotes ways to reduce air pollution.
Advisory has included:

• Reduce driving and fuel consumption by using public transportation, walking, carpooling, or riding a bike;
• Ask employers to consider flexible work schedules or telecommuting;
• Trip-chain (plan daily trips or errands to reduce excess driving);
• Fill gas tanks during cooler evening hours to cut down on evaporation;
• Avoid spilling gas and don’t “top off” the tank. Replace gas tank cap tightly;
• Avoid waiting in long drive-thru lines, for example, at fast-food restaurants or banks. Park vehicles and go inside.
Other incentive programs that can be explored include:

• Employer pay-to-park program. Employers offer parking passes but reimburse in compensation for employees who opt not to use parking passes. Multiple cities have used this method to encourage employees to commute using alternative transportation rather than single occupant vehicles.
• Explore policies including VMT tax, tolls, or congestion pricing in downtown areas
• Implement parking pricing schemes
• Reduce the availability of on and off street parking to encourage alternate forms of transportation
• Create alternatives to single occupancy vehicle travel through the improvement of multimodal transportation options, including carpools, vanpools, public transit, and active transportation – any self-propelled, human-powered mode of transportation.",,Off

Efforts should be made to ensure that the local Fayette County extension office and the Kentucky USDA know about the agritourism uses allowed in Lexington’s rural service area, so farmers are aware of the options they may have for additional revenue streams.  These opportunities have the potential to supplement farmers’ primary business operations and may allow some farms to remain viable, where it might otherwise be difficult.  
However, these opportunities should be monitored and conditional uses closely scrutinized, using the Rural Land Management Plan as a guide.  It is important that tourism uses for the agricultural land do not have a negative impact on the farming practices that are vital to the Lexington economy.  It is possible to have a thriving agritourism industry while maintaining the integrity of the agricultural area, and it should be encouraged as a primary component of Lexington’s tourism strategy.

The zoning ordinance for the A-R Agricultural Rural, A-B Agricultural Buffer, and A-N Agricultural zones currently allow several accessory uses that are related to agritourism.

Millennials have a common fear of missing out on an enjoyable event or experience that others are having. Many of this age feel their best memories are from their shared experiences.

These young professionals make up much of the current workforce and, as the baby boomers retire, they will soon comprise the majority of the workforce. Sixty-nine percent of millennials felt that attending events made them feel more connected to the community and the people in it.
Lexington has tremendous restaurant options, while it also has the free events, music concerts, etc. aimed at keeping our young workforce in Lexington.

However, overall Lexington received a Walk Score of 34, a Transit Score of 25, and a Bike Score of 44.  These numbers indicate that the city is car-dependent and that most errands require a car.  Though the website may have included the rural area, thereby skewing the results to the non-walkable side, it still indicates that there is plenty of room to improve in this area.
 
Walkability is important for many reasons.  Walking to amenities, employment, etc. from home is good for the environment, public health, and personal budgets, also, a walkable communities drive real estate values higher.  Studies also indicate that millennials want to be able to walk or bike to work, restaurants, and retail.  According to Smart Growth America’s “Foot Traffic Ahead:  2016”, the most walkable urban metros are also the most socially equitable, since the better access to employment and lower transportation costs (no car expense) offset the higher costs of housing.   

In addition to providing a walkable and bikeable environment, it is important to also increase the level of service for our transit operations.  The best way to do this is to increase ridership and make land use decisions that put people near the areas that are most easily served by transit, and encourage transit-oriented development patterns along our major corridors.

This system will provide continuous bike and pedestrian connections, a lush green band through downtown, connections to new and existing parks, and improvements to water quality. Town Branch Commons will also connect the Legacy and Town Branch Trails, completing a 22-mile trail network that can be used for far more than just recreation.  A project of this scale needs support from all community stakeholders with public and private partnership. The project is already energizing multiple facets of private developments along the corridors, with increasing interest among new businesses and residents. 

During comprehensive plan community discussions, the general public indicated broad support for the overall concept of continuing to preserve the outlying horse farms that are widely represented as Lexington’s identity. As has been mentioned before, these farms are not only pretty to look at, but are vital in direct and indirect impacts to Lexington’s economy.  In recent years, the horse farms have started to embrace connections with the urban population, opening up their doors with Horse Country tours. This creates a personal connection between the urban and rural areas and strengthens Lexington’s identity, which assists in bringing more people and businesses to Lexington.",,Off
Theme C - Livability Policy 9,9,Promote economic development through the preservation of strategically and appropriately located industrial and production zoned land.,en,"topic: Economic Development, Quality of Life",C1:C2:C3:E1,C1a:C2a:C2b:C2c:E1b:E1d:E1e,Strategically Preserve Production Land,"The creation of adaptive reuse regulations was an acknowledgment that many of Lexington’s older industrial zoned sites were no longer suited for modern economic development purposes.  As those properties became vacant and dilapidated, it presented opportunities to support the urban core with businesses and residential options better suited for their urban environment.  However, it is still critical to provide a base of industrial zoned land, in strategic locations well served by appropriately scaled infrastructure and available transit service.  Where sites have existing historically significant structures that can be reused or updated, all care should be taken to do so.  

While Imagine Lexington is in large part focused on designing places that can accommodate a wide mix of uses, industrial and production land stands out uniquely in that there should be little encroachment by residential land on these areas, and vice versa.  Just as important as preserving the industrial land is closely monitoring the adjacent land use development patterns.  Appropriate buffering and transitions should be applied so that there can be minimal use restrictions applied on these industrial properties.  It is important that production land remain flexible and wide-ranging in the uses allowed. The vast majority of heavier industrial and production uses are not suited to be within close proximity to residential and retail areas.

Other common themes of Imagine Lexington, however, are still very much a factor in future industrial and production growth.  These areas should pay special attention to their design features as well.  In meeting and discussing issues with industrial business owners, transportation for their workforce was identified as a serious hurdle they have to find unique ways to overcome.  Many of the problems identified have their origins in the initial site design and location of the industrial corridor in which they are located.  While it may not initially sound intuitive, full multimodal transit infrastructure is of the highest importance.

All new development and redevelopment proposals should consider other design elements so that all industrial land can be as efficiently used as possible, thus ensuring there is growth potential for the future.  Minimizing parking, appropriate landscaping and providing ample connectivity are all a part of taking a strategic approach to economic development areas.","Inventory and analyze existing industry and production land, identifying areas to enhance or repurpose based on market and locational factors.",Off

As new ventures, there are barriers that these young companies must overcome, such as a lack of credit and a need for mid-level space of about 1,000 square feet or larger.  Some companies engaging in research and development may require more specialized and larger (around 5,000 square feet) spaces with water, hoods, etc., while some only require Wi-Fi and a small space to occupy.  New modern co-working spaces like Base 110 in downtown Lexington provide flexible office space with shared common areas for like-minded professionals to work and collaborate.  Additional similar creative working spaces should be pursued to encourage entrepreneurs and new small businesses.

University of Kentucky’s on-campus business incubator, Advanced Science & Technology Commercialization Center (ASTeCC), houses new and rising technology-based companies located within the engineering complex.  ASTeCC has 80,000 square feet, and was funded by the Economic Development Administration and Small Business Administration.  It currently has about twenty-five companies, two-thirds of which are owned by UK faculty; the rest are from out-of-state.  Fifty-nine companies have ‘graduated’ from ASTeCC since it began in 1994.  The companies have access to other shared-use facilities on University of Kentucky’s campus, such as the Electron Microscopy Center, Center for Nanoscale Science and Engineering, and Mass Spectrometry Facility. 

The Bluegrass Small Business Development Center (SBDC) serves Fayette and 14 counties in the region.  The Bluegrass SBDC helps make dream businesses come true by providing business consultants to assist with strategic market research, access to capital and loan packaging assistance, business and strategic plan development, and analysis and start-up assistance, among other services.  The consulting is free of charge.  

Commerce Lexington assists in placing businesses, not only on new sites, but also in all types of existing buildings.  Commerce Lexington keeps an inventory of available locations and works with businesses and other agencies to place businesses looking for space to rent.  Landlords of large professional office spaces may be hesitant to divide up those spaces to accommodate a business looking for smaller footprints.

Another company helping to remove barriers to second-entry employment is DV8 Kitchen, a ‘fast-casual restaurant and bakery’ started by the owners of the Saul Good restaurants in Lexington.  The company provides fresh, natural food designed to “change your life.”  According to Rob Perez, one of the owners of DV8 Kitchen, there are barriers to people trying to make a second-entry into the workforce after addiction or incarceration.  Some of the employers do not want to pay for training for what they think will be short term employment, they worry about provision liability for workman’s compensation coverage (even though it is already figured into liability insurance), and they have practicality issues.  Mr. Perez believes an employee certification program would alleviate many of these barriers by providing such things as required weekly drug tests, counseling, 12-step programs, etc.  He also indicated a need for government incentives to educate employers about providing opportunities for jobs for these members of society, as opposed to precluding them from employment entirely.  The DV8 Kitchen’s goal is for one-third of their staff to be second-chance employees.  Imagine Lexington advocates for encouraging employers to provide job opportunities, returning hope to members of society who are struggling to recover from past circumstances.

Eliminating the commute to work, avoiding the cost of leasing or owning space for a business, and being near loved ones are among the reasons that make working from home attractive.

The U.S. Census Bureau states in its report, Working at Home is on the Rise, that the number of home-based workers increased by 4.2 million between 1997 and 2010.  In addition, the American Community Survey, by the U.S. Census Bureau, shows that, between 2010 and 2017, the number of home-based workers increased by another 2 million.  
 
The report also states that there has been a 69% increase in home-based work in the computer, engineering, and science occupations.

The program has been in existence for nearly 20 years, with PDR easements protecting farmland for food security and for conservation of environmentally sensitive lands.  Currently, 23% of the Rural Service Area (28,953 acres) is protected by PDR easements, with a stated end goal of 50,000 total acres, or 39% of the Rural Service Area, to be protected.  Fayette County has committed millions to pay for PDR easements, which protects soils for the future.  According to Beth Overman, Director of the PDR Program, most of the PDR easements are equine farms.  These famous soils in the Rural Service Area, with many acres protected by PDR, provide nutrients that grow vigorous crops, as well as healthy, strong horses, cattle, and other livestock.  

Bluegrass soil produces quality racehorses, which result in big purchase prices.  Keeneland sales showed a rebound from the recession in 2011 and 2013 sales, but a leveling off between 2013 and 2017, with a slight upward turn in 2017.

Sales appear to be holding steady, but have yet to approach pre-recession levels.  Hopefully, initiatives like Horse Country tours, which are trying to build a new base of race fans, will help to bolster sales and increase interest in the sport.

Horse Country’s website states that their mission is to, “Connect guests to the horse, land, and people through experiences that inspire love of the animal and Kentucky.”  Over the past three years, Horse Country, Inc., has sold 72,222 tour tickets to horse farms in Lexington and four other counties.

These tours should be publicized as much as possible, since they showcase a unique asset in Lexington that is not found anywhere else in the world.  

Another driver of the agricultural economy in Lexington is The Bluegrass Stockyards, founded in 1946.  The Bluegrass Stockyards’ new facility, located on Iron Works Pike, was built after the company’s original Lisle Industrial Avenue facility was destroyed by an accidental fire in January 2016.  Bluegrass Stockyards employs about 50 people at the Lexington location; the company also currently operates seven live sale locations and an internet sale system, with a total employment of over 200. 
 
The Lexington market “will handle $200-$250 million in business annually,” and sells 100,000-125,000 heads of cattle a year, with the entire network of seven live sale locations and internet sales selling about 500,000 heads of cattle annually, collectively.  The Bluegrass Stockyards will handle over $600 million in transactions overall, with a customer base from 90 counties in Kentucky and eight surrounding states.

Industrial Hemp remains a Schedule I Controlled Substance under state and federal law.  Individuals and businesses that wished to be considered to join the Hemp program to grow, handle, process, or market hemp were required to apply for a license by established deadlines.  To date, more than 50 processors/handlers have obtained licenses in the KDA Hemp Program, which began in 2014.  In 2017, there were 3,200 acres planted, with 2,300 acres harvested.

Shared parking is a land use/development strategy that optimizes parking capacity by allowing complementary land uses to share spaces, rather than producing separate spaces for separate uses.

Shared or flexible parking with adjacent users may offer opportunities to better streamline maintenance costs, provided that the operational challenges of sharing such a critical resource can be alleviated.

In response to Theme C Goal 3, city officials worked with the University of Kentucky (UK) to execute a land swap addressing Lexington’s need for employment land.  The result was a transfer from UK of 50 acres that are “shovel ready” within the confines of the existing research park, as well as an additional 200 acres, currently used as a dairy cow research farm directly adjoining the park.  The site located between Georgetown Road and Newtown Pike offers a location near the interstate ideal for attracting high-wage jobs, creating employment options for Lexington and generating payroll revenue for the city.

Having adequately trained farm labor is crucial to continuing the success of this important part of Lexington’s overall economy.  Nationwide there are two jobs in agriculture for every new agriculture job seeker.  Hiring has become increasingly difficult, and while there is increasing reliance on new agricultural technology, there is both a need for skilled, trained workers to operate the equipment, and a need for skilled farm workers doing manual farm labor.  Larger operations are more likely to use agricultural technology due to the cost of the equipment, while smaller operations or very specialized operations rely more on skilled manual farm labor.  

Additionally, recently increased immigration enforcement compounds the concerns of the ongoing lack of farm labor. To legally bring farm workers from other countries to provide farm labor, the Federal H-2A program enables farm employers to recruit foreign nationals to the United States for temporary work.  However, some smaller operations don’t have enough work to go through the trouble of using the H-2A program. Larger operations, however, are using the H-2A program successfully.  Many larger farms hire an H-2A broker to do the paperwork and process for them. Kentucky is 7th of all the states for the number of farm workers that come under the H2A Visa program according to the Office of Foreign Labor Certification.  

Examples of efforts to increase the supply of farm workers that could be done locally (some presently undertaken), would be to recruit or continue to recruit seasonal/temporary farmworkers from students enrolled or graduating from Locust Trace AgriScience Center, UK College of Agriculture, and other agriculture related education and training programs throughout the United States.  Another possible source may be second-entry workers trying to re-establish their lives after rehabilitation from addiction or from having judicial records.  There are also farm therapy programs for military veterans using agricultural therapy.  Examples of such programs are the West Virginia Veterans and Warriors to Agriculture program through the WV state agriculture department where veterans learn about Ag practices to harvest crops and grow food.

Also, though not universally applicable due to costs, agricultural technology and equipment could be an answer to a shortage of farm workers for some types of farms.  Programs and agencies that provide financial assistance to farms in acquiring technology and equipment should be promoted.  Educational and training programs that train farmworkers how to care for use agricultural technology and agricultural equipment should be maintained and increased.",,Off

True multimodal street designs must acknowledge how adjacent land uses and building forms influence user perceptions, needs, and safety. Understanding these contextual relationships leads to improved street design.  When designing or modifying a street, it is crucial to consider the current and potential future adjacent land uses for the site and block.
Different land uses generate varying amounts of vehicular traffic and on-street parking, and have different frontage and multimodal needs.  The land uses adjoining a street are integral to predicting the volume of multimodal demand and the best allocation of right-of-way to support those needs.  Consideration should be given to both existing and potential future land uses. 
Although many neighborhoods and corridors currently have auto-oriented land use patterns and site designs, the development of multimodal street networks is intended to change the city’s transportation system and travel patterns over time.  That focus on multimodal transportation is designed to work in conjunction with infill and redevelopment efforts that emphasize a greater mix of uses, walkabilty, transit-oriented development and community centers with proximity to destinations.  As neighborhoods and corridors evolve over time, emphasis should be placed on creating opportunities for walkability, even in areas where the full potential has yet to be realized.

Streets should be not be singularly designed for automobile efficiency, but should give due consideration to the surrounding context, and the goals for the place-type where it is located.  They should add to an area’s sense of place and promote desired development patterns, rather than discourage them with designs that are out of scale and counterproductive to the preferred result.",Amend Subdivision Regulations street standards.,Off

Achieving this goal requires all modes of transportation be considered equally during the design of rights-of-way. From the earliest stages of development, it should be acknowledged that bicyclists, pedestrians, transit users and automobile drivers are all entitled to safe and accessible transportation options.

Since 2009, the Centers for Disease Control has strongly advocated for improved multimodal infrastructure, due to the over 100 studies that have shown the strong connection between obesity and automobile dependence. It is not the goal of Imagine Lexington to end car culture, but is absolutely a goal that Lexington become known for its abundant transportation options that encourage safe, healthy behaviors.

Changing behaviors does not happen simply because people know there is a healthier alternative. When each new development incorporates safe and convenient transportation options, and as needed retrofits are completed, the multimodal network becomes more robust and alternative forms of transportation become more attractive. Providing convenient transit options and alternatives makes individual neighborhoods more desirable—and creating neighborhoods that are more desirable makes Lexington more attractive to employers and employees alike.",Implement Projects from the Lexington Area MPO Bike and Pedestrian Master Plan.,Off

The removal of barriers to independent travel reduces the need for more costly alternatives such as paratransit, private transportation services, and ‘hazard’ busing for school students.  Accessibility to transportation options is an equity issue; designing streets for only one user group assumes that everyone has access to that mode of transportation.  A multimodal approach is preferable, because it allows people of all means and abilities to have viable and connected transportation opportunities.

A successful transportation network connects people to places.  Some areas still lack sufficient connections between public streets and building entrances. This inadequacy in meeting Americans with Disabilities Act requirements can affect the ability of some residents to be independent.  All new developments and modifications to existing facilities should be designed with these users in mind.

Some important considerations in addressing equity:

• Streets should be designed such that they are safe, enjoyable, accessible and comfortable for ages 8-80 and those with limited mobility.

• Incorporate design elements that enhance walkability, which include sidewalks wide enough for two people to walk side-by-side, shade from street trees, and short, direct, connected routes.

• Commercial and mixed-use areas should incorporate narrower streets lined with buildings that have little to no setback, frequent and safe crossings, pleasing furnishings, store fronts, pedestrian scale lighting, and buildings oriented toward and adjacent to the street and sidewalk.

• Horizontal and vertical scale should be proportioned to the pedestrian when designing streets.

• The 2018 Bicycle and Pedestrian Master Plan has a design matrix to help with establishing the minimum starting point to inform the decision making process on necessary transportation infrastructure. ",,Off

In general, there is insufficient understanding by the public on how a more connected street network could help alleviate traffic congestion.

Within disconnected street networks, traffic is concentrated along major roads because there are not alternative route options for commuters. Alternatively, well-connected streets provide direct, continuous routes and multiple route options, and this has proven to effectively reduce roadway congestion. Connectivity also reduces response times for emergency vehicles and improves access and efficiency for transit, school buses, and service vehicles, including solid waste trucks and street sweepers.

When traffic is concentrated to fewer roads, these roads are widened and additional lanes are added to accommodate the large volumes of traffic. Wider streets encourage faster speeds, making them more dangerous to travel as a pedestrian or bicyclist, and crossing a wider street is difficult—especially for children, the elderly, and the disabled. Of pedestrians killed in 2007 and 2008, more than 50% died on wide roadways (Earnst & Shoup, 2009.)

Instead of wider streets with multiple lanes, roadway capacity should be in-creased by providing multiple, smaller parallel streets. With a more connected street network, traffic will be dispersed along alternative routes, and the demand for wider streets will lessen.

For the above reasons, and in order to lessen traffic congestion and make Lexington’s street network safer for all modes of transportation, dead-end streets and cul-de-sacs should be discouraged except where connections are not topographically or environmentally feasible. In places where connections are not feasible for topographic reasons, safe non-vehicular access should still be provided. As stressed in Theme A, roadway connections are imperative, and should be pursued wherever possible.",,Off

These streets, which are wider by design, create faster vehicle speeds, regardless of the posted speed limit, due to the driver’s perception of a wide open space. In contrast, streets should be designed such that bicyclists, pedestrians, and mass transit riders feel comfortable and encouraged to freely share the space with automobiles. This can be accomplished through the appropriate use of traffic calming features such as roundabouts, medians, street trees, chicanes, reduced building setbacks, shorter block lengths, and narrower street widths.

Reductions in vehicle speed significantly decrease injuries and fatalities for both vehicular and non-vehicular users alike. Employing traffic calming techniques such as those listed above increases motorists’ attentiveness to the surrounding context, and if considered early in the design process, they carry the additional benefit of eliminating the need for costly traffic calming retrofits.

Studies have shown that each 1-mph reduction in average traffic speed reduces vehicle collision rates by 3 to 6 percent. Additionally, studies have shown that 80 percent of pedestrians struck by a car going 40 mph will suffer a fatality, while at 30 mph, the likelihood of death is reduced to 40 percent. At 20 mph, that figure drops to just 5 percent, illustrating the importance vehicle speed plays in pedestrian safety. The likelihood of a pedestrian collision occurring at lower speeds is also reduced due to shorter braking distances.
Rather than addressing Lexington’s roadways after the fact, designs should be initiated at the development and planning phase to create the appropriate street width to restrict vehicle speed.",,Off

These benefits include:

Safety
The safety of all users is a priority, whether they use a car, bus, bicycle, wheelchair, stroller, cane, or walk. 

Choice
Whether used to commute to work or school, to run errands, to visit friends, to go to a park, or to recreate and exercise close to home, streets must be designed with all users in mind. 
Connected streets provide multiple route options and continuous, convenient facilities without gaps, while reducing delays and congestion—creating a more efficient network.

Equity
Improved accessibility and independence.  By improving access for all, complete streets enable greater freedom of travel for people who do not drive due to age, disability, expense, or choice.

Economy
Connected multimodal streets save individuals money on direct transportation costs by making less costly alternatives to the automobile more readily available, including biking, walking, and transit. Increased physical activity from biking or walking may also save individuals on health-related costs.

Governments and communities save money with the implementation of complete streets.  With more travel options and a more connected network, public vehicles may travel fewer miles and reduce backtracking along discontinuous routes.  Allowing more people to walk and bike can reduce health costs paid by the government.  Less traffic, less pavement, and more street trees reduce the costs associated with cleaning polluted air and water. Dispersed traffic lessens the need for expensive road widening. Less pavement saves in maintenance costs. Connectivity saves infrastructure costs. Smart growth development practices generally require less initial cost to construct and maintain, as they are more compact and require fewer public services annually.

Connected multimodal streets save developers money, as shorter blocks and narrower streets generally result in less pavement. Accessibility to businesses on foot or by bike can increase patronage from passersby. Creating a sense of place and livability attracts new business and helps retain existing business. Transportation cost savings for businesses allows for reallocating or increasing profit.

Public Health & Recreation
Connected multimodal streets create an environment that fosters walking and biking, resulting in more daily activity and more healthy lifestyles. This can help combat the rising rates of obesity, asthma, and stress. Less pavement leaves more land available for additional development or greenspace, which provide additional opportunities for physical activity.

Environment & Energy
By dispersing traffic, providing efficient route options, and encouraging alternative modes of transportation, a network of multimodal streets reduces congestion and trip lengths—and therefore noise pollution, energy consumption, and emissions. Multimodal streets generally require less pavement, which reduces stormwater runoff and the heat island effect. They can also improve water quality,, through the use of green stormwater practices within the right-of-way.

More Efficient Public Services
Connected multimodal streets provide direct, continuous routes and multiple route options. This reduces response times for emergency vehicles and improves access and efficiency for transit, school buses, and service vehicles, including solid waste trucks and street sweepers. Appropriately-sized streets can accommodate large service vehicles while promoting safe driving speeds without the use of speed humps that can slow emergency response time.

Livability & Higher Quality of Place
A safe, attractive, and welcoming street is crucial to encouraging residents to walk and bike. Using surrounding land use and context to inform their design, complete streets satisfy user needs and street functions in a context-sensitive manner. Well-designed streets become quality places that provide better travel experiences for motorists, walkers, and bicyclists. Elements including street trees, landscaping, shade, lighting, building scale, building orientation, setbacks, and buffers from traffic contribute to design quality.",,Off

Access management:
Limit the number of access points to maintain the safety and aesthetics of the multi-use trail, and ensure the fewest potential conflict points between vehicles and pedestrians or cyclists.

Design guidelines:
Establish design guidelines for existing and future development adjacent to the corridor that strengthen the City’s zoning and further lay out key elements, such as: encouraging pedestrian entrances and facades that face rather than turn their backs to the multi-use trail system; defining appropriate and inappropriate uses along the corridor (e.g. back of house or dumpster locations, drive-thrus, etc.); and ensuring access to surrounding open space and trail systems.

Economic development:
Perform a study to determine the direct economic impact of potential redevelopment along the entire corridor, as well as the potential social and economic impact to the surrounding neighborhoods and downtown as a whole.  This study should also explore incentive feasibility and policy changes that may assist and guide future development along the corridor.

Green infrastructure:
Continue to make design and development decisions that work to improve the overall water quality and urban ecology of the surrounding properties which directly feed into the Town Branch Commons infrastructure and help to maintain the performative landscape established in the Master Plan.

History & education:

Such standards are needed for the benefit of government projects involving public spaces, as well as for private entities striving to build quality developments on adjoining private lands.  Without comprehensive standards that address both the public and private realms, even hard work and the best intentions will frequently not result in the high level of quality “placemaking” that the community expects and deserves.

Within the public realm, street and sidewalk design, landscaping and progressive storm water management, usable and calming pockets of greenspace, street life and art, festivals, celebrations and other special events, and transportation connections and destinations are all important.  In the private realm, there is an equally long list of design issues that must be addressed, including building mass and height, building orientation toward public spaces, provision of usable open space, design of streetscape features, location and orientation of garages and off-street parking, integration of mixed uses and diverse housing choices, and relationships to adjoining and/or surrounding land uses.  For both public and private land development, accommodating the needs of bikers and pedestrians in addition to vehicles is an increasingly important challenge.

Historically, government regulations and policies relating to development have been fairly rigid and not responsive to diverse conditions.  That needs to change.  Also, in many instances there are conflicting goals between different arms of government that ultimately discourage rather than encourage the creation of special places.  That also needs to change.

Whether a commercial development or residential neighborhood, how people will interact and move within a space needs to be considered. Successful, usable open space requires both private and public open space areas, designed and incorporated intentionally into the fabric of all development.
Currently, “usable” open space is subjective, and there needs to be a diligent effort to establish criteria to define such a space. In practice, any non-paved/built area is permitted to be considered open space. Truly usable open space needs to be appropriately sized and needs to address different users’ demands through design. A public open space within an assisted living facility is not necessarily the same type of open space that is most suitable for a mixed-use development. During the design of a property’s development, the best open space design needs to be considered for the projected user.

Ordinance-based text needs to be updated in order to ensure implementation of usable open space. The current definition for open space is lacking emphasis on its importance, and because of this, open space is not always implemented in the most purposeful way. A definition that emphasizes the many benefits and necessary characteristics of open space is needed. These benefits and characteristics include social interaction, recreation and leisure, health, safety, education, natural or cultural resource protection, sense of place and economic vitality. These benefits and characteristics will vary by user group and will need to be assessed and personalized for each development.

When it comes to reviewing development, an updated definition is key, but more regulations would provide staff, developers and community members guidance as to what to expect for the provision and design of open space. These regulations should address size requirements, the provision of both public and private open space, and user-tailored design, as well as restrictions, exclusions and exceptions to a development’s provision of open space.

It targets public spaces (right of way, plazas, etc.) that are low risk, with the possibility of high rewards. It can be used continuously in neighborhoods, with many stakeholders. It includes a mix of small projects and short-term activities; over a long period of time, tactical placemaking projects can transform an area. Positive impacts may be slow to materialize, but they often come at a much lower cost. This form of placemaking can also be used to build consistent demand for more substantive or long-term standard, creative, or strategic placemaking projects or activities. 

In Lexington, the NoLi CDC’s Night Market is a good example of placemaking to activate an underused public space.

In order for the community to continue to move forward, there must be recognition of the importance of the past, ensuring that it lives on for future generations. 

Lexington and rural Fayette County have a rich and diverse cultural history that began before statehood.  This heritage is evidenced in the natural environment of the County’s rural landscape and the built environment of its urban areas. The cultural landscape includes agricultural and horse farms, landscape features, barns, outbuildings, fences, and archaeological sites.
Historic and architecturally signiﬁcant buildings are important in that they create a unique place to live and work.  A well-planned community incorporates both the new and the historic; a balance that attracts businesses, residents, and tourists who seek a unique environment.  Historic properties and sites are resources that provide citizens not only with places to experience and enjoy, but also economic development and tourism opportunities.  

The preservation of historic buildings, neighborhoods, landscapes and other cultural resources provide beneﬁts to the citizens that in many ways cannot be measured.  These benefits include:
 
• Sense of Place provides a visible symbol of our heritage, a connection to the past, and a source of pride.  Historic buildings, neighborhoods, signiﬁcant rural landscapes and other places have unique characteristics, deﬁne the community, and have qualities that are, in many cases, indeﬁnable. These buildings, neighborhoods, rural landscapes and other places are resources that are important to protect and preserve.
• Cultural Tourism, which includes historic, cultural, and preserved sites, is one of the major reasons that people travel to selected destinations.  The rich historic and cultural heritage of Lexington includes a variety of sites making it a prime destination for cultural tourism.

• Economic Benefits from historic preservation accrue in a variety of ways. Federal and State Historic Tax Credits may be available as an incentive for historic restoration and to offset some of the costs.  Preserved buildings can be put to use as economic generators, for both public and private use, as the renovated Courthouse Square demonstrates.

• Community Pride & Accomplishment are by-products of preservation efforts as citizens of the community become involved in projects that protect or enhance important symbols of their heritage.

Lexington has protected assets through National Register designation of historic districts (25), landmarks (3) and individually listed properties.  Numerous other structures throughout the community have been voluntarily preserved, and recognized by the Blue Grass Trust for Historic Preservation, a local non-profit organization that strives to protect, revitalize and promote the special historic places in our community in order to enhance the quality of life for future generations.   

Lexington designated its first local historic district in 1958, with the protection of Gratz Park, a small near-downtown neighborhood between West Second and West Third Streets.  Since that time, 15 districts and two landmarks have been so designated, and are under the jurisdiction of the Board of Architectural Review. The districts are as follows: Ashland Park, Aylesford, Bell Court, Cadentown, Constitution, Elsmere Park, Fayette Park, Gratz Park, Mulberry Hill, Northside, Seven Parks, South Ashland/Central Avenue, South Hill, Western Suburb, Woodward Heights.  (MAP TO FOLLOW).  The two locally protected landmarks are Helm Place in the Rural Service Area and St. Paul A.M.E Church located on N. Upper Street near West Third Street.  
The community has continued to designate local historic districts at the pace of about two per decade, and in recent years, even expanded the Western Suburb local historic district. Although local historic district designation is one way to protect historic structures and the neighborhoods that surround them, the community should continue to work to encourage preservation of structures that have value within the community, and to support adaptive reuse or incorporation of such structures into redevelopment projects. Consideration should also be given to existing historic neighborhoods that are adjacent to proposed development. Infill and redevelopment projects should take extra care to acknowledge the architectural character, materials, height and mass, scale and connectivity of historic neighborhoods, and create developments that enhance these areas.  

A number of roadways throughout the community have been recognized for their cultural and scenic value.  Such designation includes scenic byways, historic turnpikes, scenic roadways and corridors, and rural scenic roads. These corridors are a critical asset to the community’s aesthetic and branding as the Horse Capital of the World, and should continue to be protected through building setbacks, maintenance of stone fences and preservation of tree canopy, all of which add to the quality of these roadways and corridors.

Stone fences continue to be a resource along rural corridors, and even within the farms around the community.  These limestone fences were built by hand, many by slaves, and have been used in new developments to create a connection to the past.  Such fences are often on state rights-of-way and are expensive to maintain; however, stone fences have also been found within central Kentucky farms, and such fences should be identified and preserved because they are an important asset to the cultural history of the community.",,On

Adaptive reuse projects were typically located in areas where the original land uses were no longer desirable because of their lack of proximity to major travel corridors.  Many of these older industrial areas are also located very close to well established neighborhoods, because housing within walking distance of these major employers was highly desirable. Over time, some of these places were long forgotten by the public and written off as “old industrial areas”, or worse, perceived to be vacant brownfields or blighted areas that residents feared to drive through.  However, there were others who had a vision for renovation and reinvigoration, but they were hampered by the zoning requirements at the time, especially because of onerous suburban parking provisions that would otherwise have led to the demolition of existing buildings simply to provide for more surface parking.  The Adaptive Reuse provisions have allowed underutilized areas to find new life as retail, residential and commercial space, softening the blow to the local economy by relatively quickly returning that land to productive and desirable land uses.
The Zoning Ordinance was modified in 2006 to permit industrial mixed-use projects to implement a concept and recommendation of the Newtown Pike Extension Corridor Plan, which was adopted by the Planning Commission in 2002.  The adaptive reuse provisions were later adopted in 2008, as a logical progression of that concept, which allowed for the creation of the Distillery District and, later, the West SIxth Brewery.  Both projects sparked a redevelopment along their respective corridors that continues today.  

While the enabling ordinance for these projects has clearly been successful, some adaptive reuse projects have also created unintended consequences that are not being adequately addressed through the development plan process, specifically nuisance issues for neighboring properties and a lack of quality pedestrian improvements in the corridors to encourage alternatives for people to access these popular areas.  Like any good regulating document, the Ordinance should be periodically reviewed to ensure that the community’s desired outcomes are being met. The Zoning Ordinance--specifically the locational and project criteria, the list of permitted uses, and the parking requirements--should be reviewed and updated to account for the subsequent policy shifts of the last two comprehensive plans.",Update the Adaptive Reuse Ordinance.,Off

Other proposed policies throughout the document have taken aim at the regulatory side of the equation.  Another critical aspect of this policy framework is to engage the public along these corridors about these issues and what forms these intensifications may take.  Long Range Planning has already begun meeting with various commercial landowners, developers and property managers about their visions for their sites and how they can take advantage of the already modified zoning tools 

Corridor studies will be a partnership between the Division of Planning, the Metropolitan Planning Organization and the respective corridor’s commercial stakeholders about future land uses and transportation needs.  The public involvement will be critical to cultivating buy-in, just as it has been on every previous small area plan.  Of the utmost importance will be setting milestones to achieve a level of commercial and residential intensity to support mass transit along these corridors.  The goal will be to think big and for the long term, while allowing policymakers to act incrementally.

They serve the city as a whole, in comparison to smaller parks, which meet local needs. Such parks are typically fairly large in terms of acreage, and often include significant environmental features such as waterbodies, floodplains, forests or sensitive natural habitats.  

According to YOUR PARKS OUR FUTURE, Regional Parks and Nature Parks tend to be located regionally, while serving citywide needs. The LFUCG Division of Parks and Recreation currently operates five (5) Regional Parks: Coldstream, Jacobson, Masterson Station, Shillito, and Veterans. Although these parks are well distributed, gaps exist in the northeastern and western portions of Lexington. The city also has three Nature Parks (four counting The Arboretum), which are also distributed throughout the county, but none are located in the north or west. Raven Run and McConnell Springs experience heavy use, which could lead to negative impact on the character of the sites and user experiences. More natural areas and more nature parks like Raven Run in other parts of the county are requested among the Parks Master Plan citizen surveys.

YOUR PARKS OUR FUTURE also recommends proposed regional and nature parks, and identifies four new or expanded parks in Lexington that would help to meet the needs of the growing population of the city. These improvements represent the development of one existing park, one private park, and two long-term acquisition areas. Although the need for the development of the new parks is long-term, the acquisition of the land of these potential parks should be considered before the necessary land is no longer available or becomes cost-prohibitive. Lexington should investigate opportunities for the acquisition of land for a future Regional Park in the northeast portion of Fayette County to meet the needs of a growing and underserved area. The city should similarly explore potential acquisition of land for a new Nature Park (or preserve) to be located to the west of the Urban Service Boundary to meet expanding regional demand and to prevent overuse of existing natural areas. 

Expansion of Cardinal Run to a Regional Park would address the gap in service for Regional Parks in the western portion of Lexington. The City of Lexington and the Division of Parks and Recreation also continue on the efforts for proposed Town Branch Park, with public and private partnership. This park would provide a much-needed regional recreational attraction in downtown Lexington.

Other parks could be integrated into the expanding system of public greenways and trails scattered throughout the county, and located to complement those private rural lands that are being preserved through the Purchase of Development Rights (PDR) program.  While a thorough study and analysis of potentially available priority land will ultimately be needed, certain areas that include prominent creek watersheds immediately come to mind as possibly offering excellent opportunities, such as Boone Creek, North and South Elkhorn Creeks and Town Branch Creek.

Funding for a regional park system will be a major challenge, but that alone should not serve as a defining deterrent.  Many determined communities across the country have responded to funding needs in creative and progressive ways.  Through a combination of local government investment, support from the development review and approval process, and citizen/corporate contributions via establishment of private foundations, an outstanding array of parks at a regional scale can be created.","Implement the recommendations from the Your Parks, Our Future Parks Master Plan.",On

The design and integration of schools into the surrounding neighborhood is as important to the desirability of an area as is the design, layout and architecture of the streets and residences.

The school property itself, as well as its location within and its relationship to the surrounding neighborhood, is crucial and should be accessible, visually as well as physically. Elementary and middle schools should locate in residential neighborhoods on local streets with provisions for safe pedestrian and bicycle accessibility. This will minimize walking distances and reduce traffic congestion in these areas. High schools and small higher education campuses, which produce a higher volume of school-generated traffic, should locate along collector streets. Schools with frontage along single-loaded streets, whether local or collector, are strongly encouraged, as they provide better public access, improved visibility, and a means for buffering adjacent residential properties. The site design of each school should facilitate all modes of transport to and from the school property and should include sidewalks, shared-use paths, and roadways that can accommodate the bus and vehicle traffic associated with the site.

Site design for publicly owned properties, whether they be government properties, utilities or public schools, require a Public Facility Review to determine compliance with the Comprehensive Plan.  Typically, an applicant, such as Fayette County Public Schools (FCPS), Bluegrass Field (airport) or some other public entity, provides a site plan, along with a detailed description of the project, for the Planning staff to review as it relates to the current Comprehensive Plan’s goals and objectives, as well as text.  At this stage in the process, the staff reacts to the general land use and the site design.  FCPS and Planning staff always communicate during the Public Facility Review process; prior to that, however, input by the Planning staff into the site design would help to ensure compliance with the Comprehensive Plan on multiple levels – not just with regard to the use of the land as a public school.

While emphasis must be placed on creating classroom spaces with layouts and technology that support students’ intellectual growth, it is just as important to consider the influence of the natural landscape in creating an ecosystem where students can foster growth and resilience.
It has become increasingly apparent that a fast-paced, urban environment can have significant effects on students’ mental health.  With children spending a greater amount of time indoors and in front of electronic screens – both at home and at school – there has been a marked increase in levels of stress, anxiety, and mental fatigue.  If those concerns are left unmitigated, students may not be able to maintain the vigor, motivation, and attitude that is necessary for them to achieve a productive school day.  The relatively cost-effective and surface-level solution of incorporating visible and usable greenspace on schools’ property has shown to foster a deep impact on student attitude and performance. 
Studies have shown that classroom views and experiences with nearby nature may have a causal relationship to students’ mental wellness, cognitive performance, and overall resiliency to stress and anxiety.  In February of 2018, the United States Forest Service published a research summary that synergized the findings of multiple studies for the purpose of effectively communicating the health benefits of both urban trees and greenspace.  While much of the findings therein apply to people of all ages, particularly the linkages between natural areas, active living, and physical health, the relationship between children and nature was a topic of targeted investigation.  The significant outcomes in multiple studies alluded to nature access as a potential vehicle for the improvement of cognitive function and stress recovery, specifically within the school setting.

One study, conducted by researchers at the University of Illinois Department of Landscape Architecture, found that classroom views of green landscapes can promote attention restoration and stress recovery.  The results were obtained by placing students in different classrooms, without windows or with windows, which revealed either a build space or a green space. They were then subjected to various conditions that simulated classroom tasks and activities and completed questionnaires and attention tests to assess attention restoration and stress recovery. The study found that students with a green window view scored “significantly higher on tests of attentional functioning and recovered significantly faster for a stressful experience than their peers who were assigned to rooms without view to green spaces.”  Such results have major impact on the importance of thinking quite literally outside of the box when it comes to school design.

Qualitative studies have highlighted these effects as well by narrating the positive mental impacts of schoolyard nature play through the lens of student experiences. In 2014, a study out of the University of Colorado used direct observations and interviews with students in different age groups to emphasize how the natural components surrounding their schools helped them find havens from stress, increase competence, and form healthy social interactions with their peers. For this reason, a balance of both active and passive recreation opportunities that involve interaction with nature within the schoolyard can yield measurable benefits.

In tuning into the implications presented by research in this area, Imagine Lexington gives weighted consideration of how greenery in the urban landscape, and the multi-faceted benefits it provides, plays an important role in shaping our future generations.  There is great opportunity for renovation and expansion of Lexington’s centers of learning to further reflect environments that are conducive to the intellectual growth and emotional well-being of the students who learn and play in these spaces each day.

Having become a critical form of infrastructure in the last several years (as much as water, gas or electricity), it is important to be able to provide wireless service for use by residents, commercial entities, and emergency services.  It has been stated in multiple articles regarding e911 as it relates to wireless service that a reliable e911 system can only exist if a reliable wireless service system is in place.  This supports (and is supported by) the current as well as past Comprehensive Plans.

While wireless communication infrastructure is incredibly important as noted above, it is also crucial to minimize the intrusion and negative aesthetic impacts they can bring.  Cell towers come in many shapes and sizes, but the technology to camouflage them through stealth concealments has existed for many years.  When new public or private applications come in for new towers the applicants need to show how they propose to camouflage the facility.  Every situation will be different, but every application should illustrate how the tower will either blend into the existing surroundings through context-sensitive camouflaging, or how it can function as a piece of public art that will complement the surrounding area.  Given how prevalent these facilities have become, it is vital they do not detract from the landscape, but enhance it or have zero impact.

Providing healthcare to all citizens should be an easy task to accomplish as these facilities seem to be available, but there are broader issues that prevent access to healthcare, all of which cannot be address through the Comprehensive Plan.  A greater understanding of the existing barriers to healthcare will help develop a healthier community.

According the County Health Rankings and Roadmaps, provided by the University of Wisconsin Population Health Institute, Fayette County is ranked 8th in the state for health outcomes (length and quality of life) and 11th in the state for health factors (health behaviors, clinical care, social and economic factors, and the physical environment).  This demonstrates that there is still room for improvement.
A healthy community has three basic elements:  

It starts with a healthy environment in which to live and work; one with clean air and water, opportunities for physical exercise and open space for citizens to enjoy and relax.  On a national level, public health officials and planners have been working to develop tools and information to help plan communities to support physical activity.  

A healthy community also includes preventive health, which means that citizens seek healthcare throughout their lives in order to stay healthy.  Preventive health initiatives will ensure our citizens attain high-quality, longer lives free of preventable disease, disability, injury, and premature death.

Lastly, a healthy community includes healthcare services of various types, to address various needs.  Lexington does have a range of healthcare services that have recently been expanded or are in the process of expanding, which will help to achieve health equity, eliminate disparities, and improve the health of all groups.

For instance, this group changed the way childbirth was perceived.  Prior to the “baby boomers” coming of age, childbirth was seen as a medical condition and husbands and families were excluded from the birthing process.  This did not sit well with the “boomers” who demanded changes to this archaic practice, instead viewed childbirth as an inclusive family celebration.   This is just one of many impacts this generation has contributed to society.  The disability movement as well as the creation of the Rehabilitation Act and ADA, were also largely driven by “boomers” who demanded equality.

As trailblazers who have routinely bucked previous trends these “baby boomers” want and need a variety of options as they begin considering their future housing needs. There are good examples of creative housing models elsewhere that are appealing and need to be employed so that Lexington may accommodate the growing senior population and individuals with disabilities. Lexington policy-makers and developers should embrace alternatives to homogenous detached single-family home development patterns in favor of communities with a variety of housing and living arrangement options. These could include co-housing, shared housing environments, planned communities for persons of a certain age, and accessory dwelling units to provide flexibility and affordability.

It is routinely noted that “baby boomers” and “millennials” share many of the same traits and preferences, so investing in options to serve the seniors and disabled persons of today will support the needs of future populations in this demographic. Providing developments that age well is important to make aging-in-place a possibility. It is important for Lexington to provide ample housing that is accessible, provides barrier free access, connection to services, wider doorways and hallways, and restrooms and sinks accessible to citizens with limited abilities.

This advocacy for a new way of looking at the USB is the cornerstone of this Comprehensive Plan, and is the next evolution of the nation’s first urban service boundary. It should be a revolutionary take on the concept, which could create a nationally replicable model. Council has already appropriated $150,000 to hire a consultant to assist in the creation of this process, which will determine the elements listed below. 

It will also separate the question of whether or not to modify the USB from the Comprehensive Plan, and will create a long-term plan for Lexington’s sustainability.

The Urban Service Area concept, while instrumental in retaining Lexington’s compact form and preserving farmland, is not without its drawbacks. Throughout the years, there have been many contentious debates about the size and location of the boundary. The same conversations have been occurring for years, with development interests insisting there is not enough land to develop, while others advocate for preserving farmland and halting suburban sprawl. In fact, the debate begins anew every five years with the state statute-required update to the Comprehensive Plan. Increasingly, these deliberations dominate the proceedings, and, though vitally important, they distract from many of the other crucial issues that face a city with steady growth and trending desirability.  The conversations turn from how Lexington should grow, to whether or not the USB should be modified, with each interested property owner in the Rural Service Area making their individual pitch. The resulting plans are not as robust as they could otherwise be if additional time were dedicated to other important topics and issues. It also increases the overall time required to spend on the update.  Now, staff spends roughly two years updating the plan, leaving only three years to implement.

Additional difficulties exist with expanding the Urban Service Boundary through the current five- year structure. There is uncertainty on all sides of the issue, and therefore a heightened sense of anxiety and concern.  Also, given that several major landholdings within the USB are currently held by a few large developers, some of the development interests believe that expanding the USB could provide additional opportunities for the smaller developers or builders to work. However, there is no indication that simply adding new land to the USB would alleviate this concern, as many of the same large landholders would have the means to acquire those properties as well.

However, the primary issue with the current system of determining whether or not to modify the USB is the unsustainability of the method long-term. This system will eventually lead to consuming all land in Lexington for development, even if that is decades or centuries in the future. It is crucial to create a long-range plan now; if Lexington continues to make ad-hoc decisions about whether or not to alter the boundary without such a plan in place, city leaders and citizens might not realize the potential negative impacts of additional development until it is too late. Instead, a controlled release of smaller amounts of land as truly needed to meet the Comprehensive Plan goals and objectives, understanding ahead of time which land can be used and which land is off-limits, will create a much more intentional development pattern.
Infrastructure can be more efficiently planned, and everyone will understand what the future of Lexington development is to look like.

In 1958, Lexington created the nation’s first Urban Service Boundary. Throughout the years, this boundary has seen many evolutions; it has been expanded, it has been contracted, and it has been effectively maintained for over 20 years. The American Planning Association designated the Urban Service Boundary as a “National Planning Landmark” in 1991, an award for projects at least 25 years old that are “historically significant, initiated a new direction in planning or impacted American planning, cities or regions over a broad range of time or space.” Fewer than 100 of these landmark awards have been granted nationwide, illustrating the significance of the boundary and the impact it has had nationwide, as well as locally.

The Urban Service Boundary has served Lexington well and has provided a number of benefits over the years.  Most people immediately recognize the role it has played in preserving the signature horse farmland for which Lexington is internationally known; however, it has, first and foremost, provided for more compact development patterns that reduced suburban sprawl, created infrastructure efficiencies and budgetary savings, and resulted in more sustainable development overall. For these reasons, this mechanism has been replicated in areas all over the United States and is one of the urban planning profession’s standard growth management tools. Improving how Lexington addresses such a critical part of what defines the community is one of the most important policy goals of Imagine Lexington.",Establish a new process for long-term land use decisions involving the Urban Service Boundary.,Off

There was a focus on raising the bar for future development and ensuring that public infrastructure be built to standards that more adequately addressed public health and safety. Much has changed in the community since that time, but the ordinance has only seen many small revisions to accommodate those significant changes. The last major changes to the zoning ordinance created provisions for infill and redevelopment in 2009.

Imagine Lexington is attempting to mark a significant shift in Lexington’s planning direction, one toward facilitating urban growth, enhancing existing places, and creating new desirable areas. Realizing these goals will require modernizing the Zoning Ordinance to make new projects feasible. Creating abundant new opportunities for varied housing types in order to attract new residents and businesses will be critical, and will require a top-to-bottom review of every section of the ordinance. Many of the past iterations need to be evaluated for efficacy, as well as reviewing the ordinance in light of Imagine Lexington’s focus on equity.

There is no question that, over the last 20 years, changes to the zoning ordinance have taken on a more design-based approach, once again raising the bar for future growth. Residents are 
increasingly more concerned with the quality of the place they live in. Revisions to the zoning ordinance will focus on creating great new places for people to live, work and experience.
These text amendments are called for throughout the adopted 2018 Comprehensive Plan.  To facilitate the comprehensive and imposing effort required to amend these ordinances in a meaningful way over the coming years, text amendments emanating from Imagine Lexington will first be presented for formal consideration at the Planning Commission committees.

However, it can be difficult to ascertain by simply glancing at the text of the plan what developers should be aiming for with new proposed development or redevelopment. Additionally, adjacent property owners should also be aware of which policies should be considered for a particular application, and what types of development they can expect. The Placebuilder, as the centerpiece of Imagine Lexington, is designed to catalyze conversations about how proposals further urban planning best practices, and to help define what it means to be “in agreement with the adopted comprehensive plan,” per state statute.
Rooted in the Goals & Objectives and the policies of the plan, The Placebuilder illustrates the types of development that are appropriate in various contexts, and it offers a menu of development and place-type options for applicants to choose from. This differs from a traditional land use map, because the goal is no longer about the separation of uses, but instead the building of places. Each type of development has a list of criteria that should be addressed, or shown to be inapplicable, to illustrate how proposals will meet the Comprehensive Plan. Every site is different, with its own opportunities, constraints, and challenges, and not every criterion will apply to every site. The criteria are not a checklist, but they are meant to ensure conversations occur regarding the concepts present throughout Imagine Lexington.
In 2013, the decision was made to remove the land use map that had been a mainstay of previous comprehensive plans to create flexibility and adaptability for the city of Lexington, as infill continued to be the preeminent development strategy. Imagine Lexington, as an update to the 2013 plan, looks to provide additional focus to this strategy: the development criteria create more direction as a policy-based plan.

To know if a plan is reaching desired outcomes, it is imperative to track the successes and failures so future adjustments can be made and successes replicated.  Imagine Lexington is crafted as a policy-based plan with very specific goals in mind. Basic metrics are included as a component of this comprehensive plan, but should be supplemented by additional benchmarks identified in the process discussed in Accountability Policy #1.

Also, a more robust effort to further develop a comprehensive set of measurables should be undertaken in the coming years, finding more detailed ways to track progress. This will be beneficial for the Planning Commission and staff in determining the realization of the stated Goals & Objectives; just as importantly, it will be an accountability measure, allowing the general public to follow along, be informed, and take ownership of their plan.

This resulted in abundant wide lanes of paved asphalt, but limited pathways for pedestrians, cyclists or transit riders. However, an increasing number of people use these streets in different ways; some by personal choice, others because of various constraints. There are many benefits of alternative transportation, such as biking, walking and public transit, some of which are illustrated in the Lexington Area Bicycle & Pedestrian Master Plan 2018. The study showed 30% of all car trips could be easily covered by a 10-minute bike ride or a 30-minute walk. Providing a safe and comfortable environment for non-vehicle travelers is essential to meet those needs. 
In order to provide equity to all Lexington residents, city infrastructure must be required to ensure enough space is granted for all users, including pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders, within the right-of-way.

This innovative outreach tool changed the dynamic of civic engagement for Lexington and leveraged powerful partnerships to hear from active citizens who were hungry for both food and meaningful conversation. It provided an accessible way for people to gather informally over a meal to discuss Lexington’s positive attributes and issues, as well as bold ideas and solutions to make it an even better place.

Initially, this initiative had a stretch goal of engaging 5,000 people to participate; that goal was not only surpassed, but more than doubled, with over 11,000 people contributing.  The roughly 10,000 comments that resulted from the input-gathering tools employed by the Division of Planning through this and other methods were synthesized into a Public Input Report (See APPENDIX C) that served as a key component to inform this plan. This public outreach initiative engaged far more people than previous comprehensive plan efforts,which typically brought out a couple hundred individuals. Perhaps equally significant is the diverse representation On the Table contributed. The Division of Planning heard from a much more varied group of people representing a host of viewpoints that are perhaps not always heard in civic engagement. This was only possible through the partnerships that strengthened the effort.

To build on this momentum, Imagine Lexington calls for a more permanent and ongoing way to connect the general public to decision-makers. By utilizing partnerships to create a citizen advisory panel, this plan hopes to achieve the following goals:

• Ensure input is heard from voices that are representative of the city at large, and not only highly-organized interests;
• Develop future neighborhood leaders;
• Improve the level of civic discourse;
• Offer educational opportunities so input is informed and not solely emotional.
In order to achieve these goals, the panel will be randomly selected across all demographics and geographies to serve lengthy terms as advisors to the Division of Planning and the Planning Commission. They will provide ongoing input into planning implementation items and decisions, and will be educated on current process and best practice. This will be a productive environment to discuss and test future process and outreach improvements, and a valuable tool to consistently provide ongoing public input throughout the implementation of Imagine Lexington.",Create a Citizen Advisory Panel.,Off

They play a unique role in the region’s identity and contribute to the scenic views, rural corridors and rolling hills. Despite the role stone fences play in defining the sense of place within the Inner Bluegrass Region, they are in critical danger of being lost to development and neglect.

Stone fences are made of Kentucky Limestone collected from fields, streams, or quarries and demonstrate sustainable farming practices from the 1800s. The 1990 Stone Fences of Fayette County study estimated that 90% of the stone fences in the region are gone. The development of adjacent properties has been the primary reason for their demise since 1950.

The 1994 Stone Fence Ordinance protects those stone fences located in the public right-of-way from demolition. However, as the 2017 Rural Land Management Plan finds, “the fate of stone fences remains in peril.”

An inventory was conducted for the 1990 study, and found 247 stone fences with a total length of 38.7 miles. This was a 25% loss from the 49.6 miles identified in a 1967 study. The 1990 inventory was catalogued using a measuring wheel and plotting the stone fences on a 1981 Tree Stand Atlas map sheet.

The stone fence inventory should be updated to catalogue their condition and reflect their current status. Advancements in technology should be utilized to digitally map the stone fences through Geographic Information System (GIS).

The latent effects of these successes can change neighboring communities in a variety of ways, including their economies, housing stock, and industrial development. In an effort to produce a regional vision for the future which allows all communities to benefit, a policy of collaboration should be developed with Lexington’s neighboring cities. The initial step toward the development of a comprehensive regional planning initiative can be done by first connecting economic hubs or centers of economic activity, which are generally located in the downtowns of communities. 

Connecting economic hubs can be done on two separate levels: economically, through principles of business cooperation and coordination, and physically, through the establishment of transit that provides multimodal opportunities for citizens to move between communities (see Stewardship Policy #3). By linking Lexington with the nearby economic hubs or the downtowns of surrounding communities, the city will be able to better tie the economic interests of the Bluegrass Region and develop a collaborative planning process. Regional perspective has already been initiated within the tourist industry (see Stewardship Policy #4) and through Commerce Lexington’s regional marketing, but there is still room for improvement through additional promotion of other opportunities and industries

Through partnerships with organizations like the Bluegrass Area Development District and their Bluegrass Regional Planning Council, as well as direct collaboration with surrounding economic hubs like Nicholasville, Paris, Winchester, and Georgetown, Lexington can begin to develop lasting planning relationships that benefit the region. The development of an inter-city summit, focused on fostering dialogue between communities, can be the first step in such a relationship. The establishment of downtown collaboration between Lexington and surrounding communities can also lead to additional economic development, planning, and infrastructure cooperation in the future.

Furthermore, by connecting business opportunities, the Bluegrass Region can begin to increase levels of economic security through a diverse economic base, reducing instability caused during periods of downturn. While it is imperative to have a diversity of industries within Lexington, collaborating with surrounding communities can also entice diverse industries that link the communities and utilize the full advantages of the region.

As the regional transportation network grows, a viable system of accessible transportation alternatives should be implemented for residents and commuters alike. This includes complete streets that give consideration to bicycle and pedestrian traffic in addition to cars, trucks, buses, and ride sharing options while utilizing the latest innovative advancements in technology.

In order to facilitate and maintain an effective and comprehensive transportation system, cross-border actions should be encouraged and implemented through regional transportation planning. The economic success of Lexington and the region depends upon the accessibility and connectivity of the regional transportation network. The city’s transportation network penetrates urban and rural boundaries as well as political borders. Regional transportation planning through continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive planning with the surrounding counties should be pursued, as transportation links Lexington to the rest of the world politically, economically, and socially. Transportation transcends all levels of governmental units and is vital to economic growth.

As Lexington’s population and economic activity continue to increase, so too will the demand for the movement of goods and people. Approximately half of the city’s labor force commutes from outside of the county, a trend that is expected to continue as populations in Scott, Madison, and Jessamine Counties grow at rapid rates. This will result in more people and vehicles making daily commutes, on already well-traveled arterials and thoroughfares. In addition to more commuters, an increase in trucks and freight movement is also anticipated as online shopping continues to increase and home delivery becomes more readily available.

Together, they all create a regional experience that is unlike any other; in order for them to be most effective, they must be marketed together as such.

Visit Lex already incorporates regional showpieces into their marketing materials, including their pre-planned itineraries and “top 10 things to do” list. It could be mutually beneficial for all involved for Lexington to continue conversations with the goal of increasing tourist traffic for Fayette and outlying counties. Those counties would receive visitors who may be coming due to the larger draw of the urban amenities Lexington has to offer, and Lexington would likely benefit, as those who are traveling for attractions in outlying counties will probably stay and spend a good portion of their tourism money in the city.

Blue Sky is underutilized, with much of its area occupied by surface car lots; it can accommodate industrial uses, and is the only RAC not in public ownership. Its recommended uses are primarily for warehousing, light industrial, and interstate commercial development. There are significant opportunities to more fully realize the potential of this site, and a small area plan should be undertaken for more specific recommendations.
At 271 acres, Avon is under control of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, with the exception of 79 acres that are privately held. This RAC includes several tenants, such as Lockheed Martin, which contracts for the U.S. Department of Defense.

Spindletop’s Research Campus is an office park owned by the Commonwealth of Kentucky, which includes tenants such as the Council of State Governments and the Asphalt Institute. This Rural Activity Center is zoned for professional office uses. There are opportunities there for additional professional office developments which would be well suited for corporate headquarters, as the land is already zoned for professional office.

A three-year study of Fayette County’s rural settlements, begun in 2002, documented their character and history and gave policy recommendations to protect each of their unique identities, all of which were included in the 2007 Comprehensive Plan. While some actions have been taken as a result of these policy recommendations, many of these small rural settlements remain threatened. Threats include potential urban expansion, population decline, possible gentrification if redeveloped, and loss of unique identity.

To protect and preserve Lexington’s rural settlements:

• The current lotting patterns should be maintained, unless the action taken would restore the parcel’s historic condition;
• New housing opportunities on vacant lots should be promoted to ensure the longevity of the rural settlements;
• An ND-1 or H-1 overlay, tailored to the needs of these individual communities, should be considered;
• Infrastructure measures that both improve the quality of life for residents of the rural settlements and are compatible with the Rural Service Area should be explored, including transportation and public transit, tourism, and internet/Wi-Fi connection;
• Consider adjusting the PDR program’s evaluative point system so applications which include farmland adjacent to rural settlements are awarded additional points;
• Identify local land use advocacy groups to partner as stakeholders in the development of policy and education/outreach efforts within rural settlements;
• The policy recommendations for rural settlements from the 2007 Study of Fayette County’s Small Rural Communities and the 2017 Rural Land Management Plan should be implemented.

The I/R Area boundary is based on the 1934 urbanized area of Lexington and its surroundings, which was primarily developed in traditional patterns prior to the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance. The special provisions in the Zoning Ordinance for this defined area are designed to complement those historical patterns, by allowing and promoting opportunities for compatible growth in older neighborhoods.


Prior to the I/R changes, there were many concerns about inappropriate infill in some areas of town, and lack of infill opportunities in others. The changes were intended to promote development that enhances the livability of the neighborhood, add appropriate density, and promote affordable housing, all while adding value to areas of town that were previously overlooked because the primarily suburban Zoning Ordinance provisions were out of place in these neighborhoods.

Throughout the years, the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance related to infill and redevelopment have been modified to ensure they were accomplishing these goals. It is time to revisit these regulations with a context-sensitive approach to assess whether they are in line with the stated Goals and Objectives, or if they are producing undesirable development within the I/R Area.",Update the Zoning Ordinance to reflect the Imagine Lexington’s infill policies.,Off

Demographically, Baby Boomers were looking to downsize, along with new young professionals beginning to demand smaller housing types located closer to amenities. Recent developments near downtown do not indicate any anticipated shift in these preferences. Current and proposed projects like Town Branch Commons, the Krikorian entertainment complex, and the Lexington Convention Center will be catalytic in spurring additional smaller developments downtown, and Imagine Lexington should anticipate ways to encourage those projects.

A new Downtown Master Plan that specifically focuses on identifying opportunities for redevelopment along with supported strategies is needed to continue revitalizing the urban core. This should be led by the Downtown Lexington Partnership, with strong collaboration with Planning, additional governmental and quasi-governmental agencies, and other critical stakeholders like downtown neighborhoods and businesses.  A revised plan will hopefully be a catalyst for attracting new development, while also meeting the needs of existing downtown interests.

Downtown residents have repeatedly expressed a desire for more neighborhood-serving commercial development. Turning those wishes into reality requires working with Lexington’s urban neighborhoods to address the provision of additional housing to support further commercial opportunities. With the substantial private investment in student housing in the near-campus areas, Lexington has seen commensurate development of new commercial options intended to serve residents. The redevelopment of the Euclid Kroger and the planned construction of the five/six story mixed-use Hub developments on Pine Street/Upper Street (shown below) and Virginia Avenue/South Limestone Street indicate that providing substantial housing opportunities does attract further economic development.
The growth in the university population, in this case, is having a positive impact in attracting businesses that students and neighborhood residents need, and that increase their quality of life. Acknowledging the need to provide additional future student housing in the near-campus area is critically important, in that it serves to relieve housing pressures from adjacent neighborhoods. However, part of the process of identifying new opportunities will be analyzing existing areas that have already seen substantial irreversible change and may be in need of full redevelopment.",,Off

It is vital that this identity be preserved and maintained through the designation and preservation of greenspace; growth should strike a harmonious balance between development and preservation. Lexington has and should continue to provide abundant new greenspace and greenways, while preserving existing natural areas that continue to foster and promote growth.

Greenspace and greenways are essential to the quality of life expected by Lexington’s citizens and are imperative to attracting new businesses and skilled workers. Greenspace should not be subjugated to the rural service area; rather, greenspace and greenways should play a prominent role in how the urban service area is developed. As the community continues to grow, more projects such as the Legacy and Town Branch Trails should be considered and implemented, and more neighborhood parks should be created.

Greenspace is more than horse farms, parks, and forests; it also includes streams, sinkholes, the Kentucky River, and the prime soils provided by Lexington’s karst topography. Greenways are linear corridors, not unlike roads and trails, which can provide critical linkage and protection of natural and cultural resources. Both new and existing corridors should be made complete with green infrastructure.

The natural topography of the Bluegrass offers abundant opportunities within the urban service area for greenspace. Greenspaces provide for recreational tourism, healthier living habits, and socially equitable open spaces. The scenic, environmental, and cultural impact of allocating greenspace and greenways is vital to a healthy and thriving urban environment.

The issues, concerns, and policy recommendations of both the 1994 Greenspace Plan and the 2002 Greenway Master Plan should continue to be considered and implemented. Both plans should be updated, taking into account new advancements in technology, growth, and development.",,On

The most drastic examples of this in Lexington were in the older industrial areas located within the defined Infill & Redevelopment Area.

Historically, major employers wanted to be near railroad access and housing that would allow their employees to walk to work, which is in contrast to more recent suburban-style priorities of having easy highway access and separation from residential properties. Many older industrial buildings nationally have become highly underutilized, due to the need for most new industrial uses to locate in large buildings that are more cost-effective when built new, with better access to transportation corridors. Several small users could utilize the abundant vacant square footage, but a common problem was that the combined parking requirements of several small users could rarely be met onsite, or even in the general vicinity, without major demolition to provide new surface parking lots.

In 2012, the city partnered with the developers of the Distillery District and National Avenue to pass a first-of-its-kind Zoning Ordinance provision that would allow flexible uses and lower parking standards, providing a type of redevelopment flexibility second only to the core downtown zones. From inception, the adaptive reuse provisions of the Zoning Ordinance were designed to further the Goals and Objectives of the Comprehensive Plan, promoting the sustainable practice of reusing existing buildings, minimizing the need, in some cases, for new construction. The provisions were written with large-scale corridor redevelopment in mind, allowing phasing of the development to occur, recognizing that large-scale redevelopment projects rarely happen overnight. Since the adoption of the new regulations, these Adaptive Reuse Projects have generally been successful for large-scale redevelopment - with some unintended negative consequences, such as the lack of options for multimodal access, resulting in overcrowded parking.

It is time to revisit this ordinance and strengthen it to achieve the current Goals and Objectives of the Comprehensive Plan, ensuring that adaptive reuse projects enhance their surrounding neighborhoods, provide more opportunities and options for a livable and walkable environment, and become anchors for re-investment in existing neighborhoods. A possible approach to strengthen the adaptive reuse provisions is to create a context- sensitive design methodology, with differing guidelines for large corridors and individual projects; and, perhaps, the ability to apply the adaptive reuse principles to properties other than industrially-zoned areas.",Update the Adaptive Reuse provisions in the Zoning Ordinance.,Off

Through the utilization of existing preservation policies, specifically through the Division of Historic Preservation, and through partnership with organizations like the Blue Grass 
Trust for Historic Preservation and the National Register of Historic Places, Lexington can protect, preserve, and enhance its stock of historic properties, which act as a bridge between present day and Lexington’s 243-year history.

While the preservation of Lexington’s historic properties is important, it is equally critical to distinguish between properties that contribute to the historical record, and those that are less significant historically. During the development process, the age of properties is frequently utilized as a guideline for preservation in opposition to new construction. However, the 50-year test, which is often referred to as the test of longevity, must be corroborated with levels of historic significance. Historical significance of a site considers the impact on or importance to American history, architecture, archeology, engineering, and/or culture, and can be attributed to districts, sites, buildings, structures, and/or objects (National Register Criteria for Evaluation).

The significance of the property can generally be broken down into four primary criteria of influence: an area of important events, association with significant persons, a unique or distinctive type, or the potential to yield important information. Furthermore, the property must possess high levels of integrity regarding location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, and association. These criteria for preservation and/or enhancement of a structure should be employed to analyze the importance to the history and character of Lexington.
Through this crucial evaluation process, properties and districts that contribute to the historical record, as well as representative samples of architectural stylings, will be preserved for future generations to experience. However, without a critical review of a property’s contribution, Lexington will see a proliferation of unsubstantiated calls for preservation that can hinder the growth and densification within the urban service boundary.

Additionally, a proactive and comprehensive inventory of historic assets should be undertaken by the Department of Planning, Preservation, and Development to identify architecturally and historically significant properties.  This should result in the initiation of additional H-1 Districts, as appropriate, to supplement the 15 existing districts that fundamentally contribute to Lexington’s urban fabric.  Ideally, this assessment should be completed prior to development proposals to eliminate confusion as potential developments are evaluated.",,Off

American economic shifts have resulted in less need for stepdown zoning, as today planners are less likely to need to address mitigating the impacts of manufacturing and industrial uses on less intense areas directly adjacent. On the other hand, preservation efforts of the last few decades have increased the desire to mitigate issues of context between old and new. Lexington’s local economy has undergone a similar transformation over the last few decades. While the tobacco industry has waned, the city’s service and healthcare industries have grown significantly. The more urban land uses of the new economy are increasingly complementary to existing residential land use patterns. Greater consideration to site design can make those transitions even more complementary and of greater benefit to neighborhoods.

Redevelopment of older industrial sites near historic areas creates an opportunity to enhance those spaces. Historic preservation efforts have succeeded in making some areas attractive for new growth around them, a testament to their success. However, creating a market for new projects is not without its own issues to monitor. Imagine Lexington absolutely supports preservation of existing historic districts, while encouraging new infill and redevelopment projects in areas around them.
Development criteria within Imagine Lexington will seek to address some of these contextual issues in order to better provide guidance to historic property owners and developers about what to expect along the boundaries of historic zones. The primary goal will be to enhance the historic areas by creating new dynamic places where people will want to live, work and visit, while not attempting to mimic or recreate the past. In the urban core, increases in land use intensity are to be expected, while still enhancing the aesthetic of directly adjacent historic areas.",,Off

But as cars have become more like computers, there has been a shift in the design process, from designing a car that can withstand a crash to designing a car that avoids the crash in the first place. With prices dropping and the availability of driver-assistance technology increasing, it is evident that the future of transportation will be tied to a smart connected city infrastructure, known in the industry as Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). This, in turn, will allow future innovations that will create more travel options.
Just as computer technology, the internet, and smart phones have transformed almost every aspect of daily lives, connected and automated vehicles will change the way citizens navigate and pay for travel. There are many experts that have envisioned a utopian future of low cost electric vehicles transporting people from door to door, while others see a dystopia of clogged streets and negative impacts on health, as fewer choose to walk. The truth is likely to be found somewhere in between these two visions, with both new benefits and unforeseen consequences. What is clear is that change is coming, and it is coming faster than ever expected. Automated and connected vehicles will affect the economy, land use decisions, data sharing, pricing, safety, available travel options, congestion, customer service, retail establishments, employment, and many other aspects of daily lives. Irrespective of the projections about how fast the full adoption of these services will be at full market saturation, the time to plan for them is now.

It is important to remember, first, that people make places and places make people. Whatever the mobility options, Lexington should adopt a “people first” attitude when preparing for a shift in land use patterns, and ensure that the thrill of a new technology enables a better future, rather than having it dictate behaviors. Lessons should be learned from society’s last major transportation shift, where single-occupancy vehicles dictated the landscape with very little regard to the unintended consequences.

In order to prepare for the future of autonomous vehicles, Lexington should be increasingly flexible in parking requirements, favoring those high-intensity uses that are well-suited as mobility hubs to aggregate and provide seamless transfers between a growing number of mobility options and ownership models. It will also be important to consider designated curbside or private drop-off and pickup areas in lieu of traditional surface parking spaces, as parking in close proximity to destinations will be less crucial. Additionally, Lexington must prepare for AV technologies to change the needs of private industries, particularly freight and retail, with less space dedicated to showrooms and increased demand for warehouses and logistical square footage.
There are a great many unknowns when it comes to the full spectrum of impacts autonomous vehicles will have on transportation, land use, and society as a whole. What is clear is that Lexington needs to strive to be proactive in anticipating these changes, leveraging them for their positive attributes while minimizing the negative. This new technology should be not be feared but embraced, and Lexington should look to be a leader in the state, region, and nation in this regard.",Update the Zoning Ordinance to accommodate and anticipate autonomous vehicles.,Off

Looking forward, as the planned corridor studies that are a major component of Imagine Lexington are completed, property owners interested in implementing the recommendations should be afforded an opportunity to take part in a Planning Commission initiated Zone Map Amendment. Leveraging the partnerships forged during the study period, a government sponsored zone change that reflects the recommendations would expedite the land use changes needed along the respective corridors. If the City has a desired outcome in these areas, proactive measures should be taken to lay the groundwork for their implementation.

Taking steps to clear the path for future development can signal to the development community that there is substantial buy-in on the planned path forward, minimizing both the risk and cost associated with redevelopment projects.

Many of these neighborhood features became non-conforming uses and slowly disappeared, for a variety of regulatory, social and economic reasons, as the development community and the Zoning Ordinance became more focused on suburban expansion, which favored the automobile and separation and isolation of uses.

Today those remaining neighborhoods, such as Chevy Chase and Kenwick (commonly known as the “Missing Middle Housing”), are highly sought after for infill and redevelopment activities, due to their ability to provide amenities like walkability and achieving a higher density without the perception of overcrowding. As this type of housing in these and other neighborhoods becomes more popular, there will be additional opportunities to provide compatible housing, new uses such as live-work units, and walk-to businesses to support the residents. The low- intensity business uses need to be integrated with the existing neighborhood, and should favor mixed-use corridors, such as Jefferson Street or Loudon Avenue, where they add neighborhood character and become focal points for neighborhood gatherings.",,Off

Shifts in consumer behavior, particularly among millennials, have contributed to a near 15% increase in online sales revenue every year since 2010. While e-commerce only makes up about 10% of the U.S.’s total retail annual revenue (with the remaining 90% coming from traditional brick and mortar stores), its unprecedented growth and accessibility has some forecasting e-commerce’s eventual reign over the retail sector. Such a changeover will likely cause traditional brick and mortar businesses, such as strip malls and big box stores, to become a less prominent component of the landscape.

To put Lexington’s commercial retail landscape into perspective, the city is currently home to 71 square feet of retail space per capita, about 1.5 times the national average of 46.6 square feet. Lexington also has a higher percentage of retail space as compared to similarly sized cities and other industrialized countries. As a city with a larger than average retail footprint, it is fair to assume Lexington will be disproportionately affected by changes in the retail market. In recent years, Lexington has already experienced the trickling effects brought on by shifting consumer habits and preferences, with the closure of several prominent national retailor locations. In response, Imagine Lexington brings to the forefront the flexibility and creativity needed to facilitate the reuse, revitalization, and/or enhancement of existing retail space, both utilized and underutilized. Recommendations to allow for a greater range in development types, particularly high-density residential, are supported by this policy, and the B-6P and mixed use zones in particular provide these opportunities.

Other U.S. cities have already begun finding innovative ways to revamp their underutilized retail spaces to better accommodate the needs of the surrounding population. One of the most noteworthy cases of adaptive reuse of retail property occurred in America’s first mall, the Providence Arcade Building in Rhode Island (built in 1828). After years of decline, the majority of this space has been converted into a community of micro-apartments, marketed to young professionals seeking affordable housing. The design features small retail businesses on the first floor, while the top two floors are composed of residential units. In another example of the revitalization of a declining shopping mall, the Main Line Health Center in Exton, Pennsylvania implemented an adaptive reuse project that converted the space into an active healthcare facility.

One of the central themes of these projects is the concept of filling a specific need of the local consumer base. In the case of Lexington, the increased need for housing units, such as what was achieved with the Providence Arcade project, could present an opportunity for developers and community designers to encourage residential uses on existing retail properties, whether by adding on to an existing property or implementing an adaptive reuse of an underutilized building.  As most large retail centers are located along major high-traffic corridors, incorporating this residential component into existing developments will also increase the viability of enhanced mass transit by increasing potential ridership.

This type of redevelopment can be mutually beneficial for the city, the future tenants, and the property owners. This additional development opportunity will allow the landowners greater return on their properties, and should also bolster the success of the remaining retail entities on the site, building in a customer base within close, walkable proximity, as well as connecting other parts of the city to the development through enhanced transit. Existing retail developers interested in strengthening their customer base should consider the incorporation of not only residential uses, but less traditional retail services such as small groceries, pharmacies, gym/fitness centers, and locations for medical and senior care.

As mentioned throughout previous themes, a growing number of residents now prefer to live and spend time in areas that are walkable and well-incorporated. Retail spaces that are within close proximity to housing, restaurants, public spaces, and entertainment opportunities could create the community-based customer experience that people are looking for.
