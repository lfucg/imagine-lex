Theme A - Design Policy 1,1,"Utilize a people-first design, ensuring that roadways are moving people efficiently and providing pedestrian infrastructure that is context sensitive to the vehicle environment and land uses.",en,"topic: Transportation, Health",A3:A4:B2:D1:D2,A3b:A4a:A4c:B2d:C2d:D1a:D1b:D1c:D1d:E1b,Utilize a People-First Design,"People-first neighborhood design requires the provision of transit/transportation infrastructure that places pedestrians, bicycle riders and mass transit users on the same level as automobiles. Mass transit infrastructure should be considered essential. Proposed developments on current transit lines or future expected routes should enhance existing infrastructure to accommodate the new or increased ridership. Shelters and seating options should be scaled, added or improved accordingly. Development should provide direct pedestrian and bicycle linkages to transit."
Theme A - Design Policy 2,2,Ensure proper road connections are in place to enhance service times and access to fire and police services for all residents.,en,"topic: Transportation, Health, Community Facilities",A4:D1:D2,A4c:D1a:D1d:D2a:E1b,Fire & Police Service Access,"There is often opposition to connecting roads between developments, as residents believe that the increased traffic will negatively affect their property.  However, it is important to note that there are many benefits to the increased connectivity that further the health, safety, and welfare of the community. “Providing a strong connected network of roads and pedestrian facilities can help distribute traffic, reduce travel distances and times, improve routing for transit and reduce walking distances."
Theme A - Design Policy 3,3,Multi-family residential developments should comply with the multi-family design standards in Appendix A.,en,"topic: Housing, Quality of Life",A2:A3:B2,A1a:A1d:A2b:A2c:A2d:A2e:A3a:A3b:A3c:A3d:B2b:C2d:E1b,Multi-Family Design Standards,"In the Winburn Small Area plan, design standards were created in order to address neighborhood concerns and to ensure that many of the problems historically created through poor design would not be repeated in the future.  Special attention was paid during the creation of the standards to ensure that new multi-family developments will be properly oriented for pedestrians and site safety, and will create a strong sense of place.  The design standards were developed with the intention of being portable for inclusion in the 2018 Comprehensive Plan."
Theme A - Design Policy 4,4,Provide development that is sensitive to the surrounding context.,en,"topic: Transportation, Economic Development, Health, Quality of Life",A2:A3:B2:B3:C1:C2:D1:D2:D3:E1,A1a:A1b:A1d:A2b:A3a:B2a:B2b:B2c:B3b:B3c:C1a:C1d:C2a:C2b:C2d:D1a:D1b:D2c:D3a:D3b:D3c:E1b:E1d,Context Sensitive Development,"Context-sensitive development is compatible and complementary to adjacent neighborhoods and communities.  It enhances the existing neighborhoods through land uses and development patterns that are sensitive to the nearby built and natural environments.  This does not mean all developments should be homogeneous or that Lexington should continue its history of highly separated land uses and residential densities, but rather new development should be connected to existing neighborhoods in a meaningful way that brings a higher quality of life to all residents by creating a sense of place."
Theme A - Design Policy 5,5,Provide pedestrian friendly street patterns and walkable blocks to create inviting streetscapes.,en,"topic: Transportation, Health, Quality of Life",A3:B2:D1:D2,A1a:A1c:A3b:A4a:B2d:C2d:D1a:D1b:E1b,Pedestrian Friendly,"Street design matters.  Creating a neighborhood environment that is not only able to be walked, but is actually inviting and walkable is vital to providing a safe way for people to move from place to place.  When designing the street facilities, developers should, “consider how to keep people walking separate from people driving vehicles; keep traffic speeds low; ensure sidewalks and curb ramps are accessible to people with disabilities; and clarify where each road user should be expected to travel” (Dangerous by Design, 2016)."
Theme A - Design Policy 6,6,"Adhere to the recommendations of the Lexington Area MPO Bike/Pedestrian Master Plan, adopted in 2018.",en,"topic: Transportation, Economic Development, Health, Quality of Life",A3:A4:B2:D1:D2,A2d:A3b:A4a:B2d:C1d:C2a:C2d:D1a:D1b:D1c:D1d:E1b,Lexington Area MPO Bike/Ped Master Plan,"The 2018 Bike/Pedestrian Plan, called ConnectLex, envisions “a network of high quality walkways and bikeways that connects communities and fosters economic growth and regional collaboration. People of all ages and abilities will have access to comfortable and convenient walking and biking routes, resulting in true mobility choice, improved economic opportunity, and healthier lifestyles. Across the region, a culture of safety and respect is cultivated for people traveling by foot or bike, whether for transportation or recreation.”"
Theme A - Design Policy 7,7,Design car parking areas so as not to be the primary visual component of the neighborhood.,en,"topic: Transportation, Quality of Life",A2:A3:B2,A1a:A2b:A2c:A2d:A3a:A3b:E1b,Parking Design Aesthetics,"New residential development should minimize the visual appearance of parking lots on streets to preserve that space for use that will activate the front yards and sidewalks for pedestrians and bicyclists. This can be achieved by placing parking lots to the rear or interior of the site, so that the building fronts along a public street. This increases the structure’s visual aesthetic, the walkability of the development, and allows for better integration into the existing pattern of the area."
Theme A - Design Policy 8,8,Provide varied housing choice.,en,topic: Housing,A1:A2:A3:E1,A1a:A1b:A1c:A1d:A2a:A3a:A3b:C2d:E1a:E1b:E1c:E1d,Provide Varied Housing,"By providing housing choices within a neighborhood, residents of a community have greater options of where to live, particularly when the components of housing choice include access to jobs and schools, affordability, and housing type. Diverse neighborhoods feature town-homes, apartments,condominiums and duplex housing adjacent to and mixed with single-family homes. They provide the opportunity for more personal interaction and security. The added population of higher-density residential development increases the viability of neighborhood-serving commercial development as well."
Theme A - Design Policy 9,9,Provide adequate greenspace for all neighborhoods within walking distance.,en,"topic: Economic Development, Greenspace, Health, Quality of Life, Community Facilities",A3:A4:B2:C2:D2,A1a:A2c:A2d:A3b:A3c:A3d:B2b:B2d:C2d:E1b,Provide Adequate Greenspace,"Greenspace is key to successful neighborhoods. It has the benefits of improving air quality, providing social interactions, and improving public health. An interconnected and accessible greenspace system consisting of vibrant and attractive public spaces, healthy natural areas and plentiful recreational opportunities create neighborhoods where people want to live.  Over the years, greenspace has evolved far beyond the definition of rural landscapes. Greenspace encompasses public parks, trails, boulevards, activity lawns, schoolyards, public plazas, amphitheaters, stormwater basins, the arboretum, cemeteries, etc.

Theme A - Design Policy 10,10,Provide neighborhood focal points accessible to all residents.,en,"topic: Transportation, Economic Development, Greenspace, Quality of Life, Community Facilities",A3:A4:B2:C2:D1:D2,A1a:A1d:A2c:A2d:A3a:A3b:A3c:A3d:A4a:B2b:B2d:C1d:C2a:C2d:D1a:D1b:E1b,Neighborhood Focal Points,"Neighborhood focal points can be a gathering space such as a park, greenspace, a shopping center, a community center or public square. To the extent possible, new residential development should be developed with new focal points in mind by allowing for easy, multimodal access from the neighborhood instead of development that turns its back on the community hub."
Theme A - Design Policy 11,11,Single loaded streets should be utilized in order to establish clear public access to neighborhood focal points.,en,"topic: Transportation, Greenspace, Health, Quality of Life, Community Facilities",A3:A4:B3:D1:D2,A1a:A1c:A2c:A2d:A3b:A4a:B2b:B2d:B3b:B3c:C1d:C2d:D2a:D2c:E1b,Utilize Single Loaded Streets,"Even passive greenspace requires clear, visible access in order to fulfill the needs of a neighborhood.  A focal point should be clearly delineated from private lots in order to be welcoming to all residents. Development of focal points on single loaded streets removes any opportunity for them to be tucked away unsafely in the backyards of private homes."
Theme A - Design Policy 12,12,Support neighborhood level commercial areas.,en,"topic: Housing, Transportation, Economic Development, Health, Quality of Life",A1:A2:A3:B2:C1:D1:D2:E1,A1a:A1b:A1d:A2a:A2b:A2d:A3a:A3b:B2d:C1a:C2a:C2d:D1a:D1b:E1a:E1b:E1d,Neighborhood Commercial,"In many neighborhoods developed decades ago, the commercial areas designated to serve as neighborhood focal points have become poorly utilized or have slowly deteriorated and need additional investment.  Proactively rezoning these sites from Neighborhood Business (B-1) to Commercial Center Zone (B-6P) would afford new flexibility at a neighborhood scale. Providing opportunities to increase residential density and professional/commercial intensity that could spur economic investment is an important step that the Government could take, using that opportunity to re-establish a new or better community focal point."
Theme A - Design Policy 13,13,Development should connect to adjacent stub streets and maximize the street network.,en,"topic: Transportation, Health",A3:B2:D1:D2,A3b:A4c:D1a:D1b:D1d:D2a:E1b,Connect to Stub Streets,"Connected streets provide direct, continuous routes and multiple route options. This reduces response times for emergency vehicles and improves access and efficiency for transit, school buses, and service vehicles, including solid waste trucks and street sweepers. Creating a robust street system with multiple routes to neighborhood destinations is unquestionably a best planning practice. Dispersing the traffic of an entire area onto multiple collector and local streets makes every street in a neighborhood desirable, and none too overburdened."
Theme A - Density Policy 1,1,The highest density of our residential development should be directed to our major corridors and downtown.,en,"topic: Housing, Transportation, Economic Development",A1:A2:A3:B2:D1:E1,A1a:A1b:A1d:A2a:A2b:A2d:B2a:B2c:B2d:C2d:D1a:D1b:D1c:E1a:E1b:E1c:E1d:E1e,High Density Corridors & Downtown,"Given Lexington’s ever-increasing population, the community’s expressed desire to create exciting walkable places, and the goal of preserving valuable agricultural land, density is very important.  However, high density development is not appropriate in every context.  As stressed within the “Design” vision and policies, density should address the context of its surroundings. Imagine Lexington intends to direct the highest density/intensity development to the major corridors and downtown area to bolster the viability of an enhanced transit service."
Theme A - Density Policy 2,2,Infill residential can and should aim to increase density while enhancing existing neighborhoods through context sensitive design.,en,"topic: Housing, Quality of Life",A1:A2:A3:B2:E1,A1b:A1c:A1d:A2a:A2b:A2c:A2d:A3a:A3b:B2b:C2d:D2a:E1a:E1b:E1d:E1e,Infill Residential & Context Sensitivity,"In areas where the preservation of existing neighborhood design characteristics is of high importance, infill residential should apply the recurring building patterns of the area. It is wholly possible to add residential units while matching the consistent rhythm of existing development, so that the new seamlessly blends in with the old. Significant contrasts in scale, massing and design should be minimized while attempting to not impact the density of a proposed development."
Theme A - Density Policy 3,3,"Create opportunities for additional neighborhood supportive uses, especially in areas where services are lacking.",en,"topic: Economic Development, Quality of Life",A1:A2:A3:C1:D1:D2:E1,A1a:A1b:A1c:A1d:A2a:A2b:A2d:A3a:A3b:C1a:C2a:C2b:C2d:D1a:D1b:E1b:E1d,Supportive Neighborhood Uses,"Ideal neighborhoods include not only a mix of housing types, but also a mix of uses, including neighborhood-serving businesses and opportunities for work and leisure.  Incorporating more of these uses into existing neighborhoods as well as new developments should be encouraged.  Not all commercial development proposals near residential neighborhoods should be considered supportive, but those that also respond to the “Design” and “Equity” policies, and provide a clear neighborhood need, can be."
Theme A - Density Policy 4,4,"Generally, locate high-density areas of development along higher capacity roadways (minor arterial, collector) to facilitate future transit enhancements.",en,"topic: Housing, Transportation, Economic Development",A1:A2:A3:B2:D1,A1a:A1b:A1c:A1d:A2a:A2b:A2d:A3a:A3b:B2c:B2d:C2a:C2d:D1a:D1b:D1c:E1b:E1d,Density to Support Transit,"This plan recommends that the highest density development should be concentrated toward the major corridors and downtown to facilitate transit-oriented development that would begin to support Bus Rapid Transit opportunities.  In a similar fashion, where high density apartment development occurs outside of those areas, it should be generally focused toward the minor arterials and collectors so that they can be more easily served by future transit service.  Additionally, reducing the number of automobile trips on local streets lowers associated infrastructure maintenance costs."
Theme A - Density Policy 5,5,Provide affordable and/or compact residential options through Accessory Dwelling Units.,en,topic: Housing,A1:A2:A3:B2:E1,A1a:A1b:A1c:A1d:A2a:A2b:A2d:A3a:A3b:B2a:C2d:E1a:E1b:E1d,Accessory Dwelling Units,"An Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) is defined as a second, smaller detached dwelling on the same property, or one that is attached to an existing single-family house, such as a basement or over-the-garage apartment.  As Lexington continues to grow, ADUs can play a role in meeting the overall housing demand. ADUs are not a new idea, and examples of them can be found throughout the United States. Old alley apartments in DC, or carriage houses in fine old Seattle homes, have been around for a long time, but they fell out of favor in the middle of the 20th century."
Theme A - Density Policy 6,6,Allow and encourage new compact single-family housing types.,en,topic: Housing,A1:A2:A3:B2:E1,A1a:A1b:A1c:A1d:A2a:A2b:A2d:A3a:A3b:B2a:C2d:E1a:E1b:E1d,Compact Single-Family Housing,"Lexington needs more housing of all types as its population continues to grow.  The 2017 Housing Demand Study shows that single-family residential options continue to be popular and will be for the foreseeable future.  However, the paradigm for providing these single-family homes is shifting from the larger suburban model lots to a more compact and urban form of single-family home, such as town-homes, fourplexes, and others. One way to provide for this type of development would be amending the regulations to allow group residential developments that include single-family housing."
Theme A - Equity Policy 1,1,Meet the demand for housing across all income levels.,en,"topic: Housing, Quality of Life",A1:A2,A1a:A1b:A1d:A2a:A2d:C2d:E1b,Housing for All Income Levels,"This Comprehensive Plan does not seek to be antagonistic toward growth and new residential development; on the contrary, continued growth is vitally important and Lexington should encourage intense (re)development in the most appropriate areas to provide housing for all.  Lexington must provide overall housing affordability, primarily through an abundant supply of new construction that puts a downward pressure on rents of existing units."
Theme A - Equity Policy 2,2,"Provide affordable housing across all areas, affirmatively furthering fair housing, complying with HUD guidance.",en,"topic: Housing, Quality of Life",A1:C2,A1d:A2d:C2d:E1b,Affordable Fair Housing,"According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) is a legal requirement that federal agencies and federal grantees further the purposes of the Fair Housing Act. HUD's AFFH rule provides an effective planning approach to aid program participants in taking meaningful actions to overcome historic patterns of segregation, promote fair housing choice, and foster inclusive communities that are free from discrimination."
Theme A - Equity Policy 3,3,Add residential opportunities by proactively up-zoning areas near transit for populations who rely solely on public transportation.,en,"topic: Housing, Transportation, Economic Development, Quality of Life",A1:A2:A3:B2:D1,A1a:A1b:A1d:A2a:A2d:B2c:B2d:C2a:C2d:D1a:D1b:D1c:E1b:E1c,Up-Zone near Transit,"In transit opportunity areas identified in subsequent corridor studies, the government should consider up-zoning properties to allow and encourage more intense uses that support transit.  Where neighborhoods already exist along these corridors, appropriate transitions and step-downs should be used, but should not otherwise deter development of additional housing.  To avoid adverse effects on low and medium density neighborhoods, transit-oriented development should be accommodated as much as possible on commercially zoned land along major arterials.  B-6P zoning should be considered along these major arterials."
Theme A - Equity Policy 4,4,"Preserve and enhance existing affordable housing through the land bank, community land trust and vacant land commission.",en,"topic: Housing, Quality of Life",A1:A2:C2,A1a:A1c:A1d:A2d:A3b:E1b,"Land Bank, Community Land Trust, Vacant Land Commission",Previous Comprehensive Plans laid the groundwork for the currently existing program infrastructure to serve our affordable housing needs.  Subsequent steps need to address the ongoing funding and identify methods for making sure these programs reach the critical mass of assets needed to become self-sufficient.
Theme A - Equity Policy 5,5,Protect affordable housing tenants through improved code enforcement policies.,en,"topic: Housing, Quality of Life",C2,A1a:A1c:A1d:A2d:A3a:A3b:E1b,Improve Code Enforcement Policies,"A rental property registration program to proactively address substandard housing conditions would help alleviate the current culture where residents are wary of contacting Code Enforcement to report violations for fear that they may lose the roof over their head.  Louisville, Covington, and Erlanger have all taken this proactive approach to this serious issue. The goal of this approach is to identify problem properties and utilize random inspections to keep landlords from delaying maintenance or poorly managing their units."
Theme A - Equity Policy 6,6,Provide flexibility for senior housing through Accessory Dwelling Units.,en,"topic: Housing, Quality of Life",A1:A2:A3,A1a:A1b:A1c:A1d:A2a:A2b:A2d:A3a:A3b:E1b,Senior Housing though ADUs,"Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs) provide significant opportunities for older residents to age in place.  They allow them to retain their properties through subsidizing their incomes with rental revenue, while they continue to inhabit the property.  When attempting to address the senior housing need in Lexington, it is important to provide a myriad of opportunities, allowing a variety of solutions.  ADUs will inevitably provide a small percentage of the needed units; but for many who take advantage of them, it could be the difference between staying in their homes, and having to sell them."
Theme A - Equity Policy 7,7,Community facilities should be well integrated into their respective neighborhoods.,en,"topic: Greenspace, Health, Quality of Life, Community Facilities",A3:A4:B2:D1:D2,A1a:A2c:A3a:A3b:A4a:A4b:B2b:C2d:D1a:D1b:D2b:D2c:E1b,Integrated Community Facilities,"School sites should be appropriately sized for the needs of the community and designed to be an integral part of the community, rather than sequestered and closed off.  Ensuring neighborhood access to these sites is important, so they can act as community-building entities.
 
HEALTHCARE, SOCIAL SERVICES
Neighborhood-level healthcare and social service options are important, especially for areas where there is a low level of automobile ownership.  "
Theme A - Equity Policy 8,8,Housing developments should implement Universal Design principles on a portion of their units.,en,"topic: Housing, Quality of Life",A1:A3:D2,A1a:A1b:A1c:A2d:A3b:C2d:E1b,Universal Design Principles,"In order to support aging in place and recognize the increasing senior housing need, Universal Design principles should be incorporated into neighborhood developments where possible. Seven principles were developed by a diverse group of professional designers to create environments that are easily accessible, understood, and used by as many people as possible. Additionally, the creation of an age-friendly development plan should be explored in order to address inequities in both public and private facilities and to raise awareness about the opportunities to improve."
Theme B - Protection Policy 1,1,Continue the Sanitary Sewer Capacity Assurance Program (CAP) and encourage the Stormwater Incentive Grant program to reduce impacts of development on water quality.,en,"topic: Health, Community Facilities",B1,E1b,Stormwater Incentive Grant & CAP,"LFUCG Division of Water Quality oversees the storm sewer system of over 800 miles of underground pipelines; 50,000 structures; and over 1,000 wet ponds and detention basins; the sanitary sewer system of over 1,400 miles of underground pipelines; and 28,000 manholes, with nearly 80 pumping stations conveying sewage throughout the Urban Service Area.

In 1958, the Urban Service Area Boundary was created to manage development, and has become a pioneering landmark for planning across the nation. In 2000, the Purchase of Development Rights Ordinance was adopted. As of August 25, 2017, there were 28,953 acres of farmland in Fayette County preserved in perpetuity by PDR, and another 1,257 acres under contract."

In general, there is insufficient understanding by the public on how a more connected street network could help alleviate traffic congestion.

Whether a commercial development or residential neighborhood, how people will interact and move within a space needs to be considered. Successful, usable open space requires both private and public open space areas, designed and incorporated intentionally into the fabric of all development.
