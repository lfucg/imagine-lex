Low Density Residential,en,LR,AA8ABA,"Primarily attached and detached single-family homes of varying formats, including accessory dwelling units.

Homogeneous neighborhoods that do not include a mix of housing types should be avoided. Low density residential is only appropriate as a component of “Enhanced Neighborhoods” and “New Complete Neighborhoods”, and should be supplemented by a variety of uses and housing options to create sustainable places.","Multi-modal network connections, including connected streets, are required to keep an efficient transportation network that provides viable options for all users.","These developments should include intentional open space designed to fit the needs of area residents, and be in walking distance of nearby neighborhood-serving commercial/employment uses.",res
Medium Density Residential,en,MR,8658A7,"Primarily attached and multi-family units.

Multi-family units should complement and enhance existing development through quality design and connections.","Nearby commercial/employment uses and greenspaces should be easily accessible, and bicycle and pedestrian modes should be maximized to connect residents to destinations.","These developments should include intentional open space designed to fit the needs of area residents, and a variety of neighborhood-serving commercial/ employment uses.",res
Medium-High Density Residential,en,MHR,6C3C98,"Primarily multi-family units.

Multi-family units should complement and enhance existing development through quality design and connections.","Access to these developments is typically through streets designated with the collector classification or above. Mass transit infrastructure should be provided along transit routes through collaboration with Lextran, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities should be plentiful to provide multi-modal options.","These developments should include intentional open space designed to fit the needs of area residents, and a variety of neighborhood-serving commercial/ employment uses.",res
High Density Residential,en,HR,3C2B81,"Primarily high-rise multi-family units.

This type of development is generally reserved for the most intensely developed areas in Lexington, with the infrastructure to support it. Where these developments abut existing or historic neighborhoods, appropriate step-downs or context- sensitive elements should be used to minimize intrusion.","Mass transit infrastructure should be provided along transit routes through collaboration with Lextran, and bicycle and pedestrian facilities should be plentiful to provide multi-modal options. Parking should be minimized in favor of multi-modal options, and where necessary, should be predominantly accommodated within garages.","Open space and greenspace opportunities should be adequate within the area to support the residents, or should be provided creatively on-site utilizing plazas, rooftop space, or other means that accomplish the goal, but still allow for high Floor Area Ratios.",res
Low Density Non-Residential / Mixed-Use,en,LNR MU,8D9AB1,"Primarily neighborhood-serving commercial uses, services, places of employment, and/or a mix of uses within low to mid-rise structures appropriately scaled to the surrounding neighborhood.

Mixed-use structures can include a mix of residential, commercial, services, and/or employment uses, and an activated and pedestrian-scale ground level should be provided. Developments with a residential component are generally non-residential on the ground-floor with units above, providing opportunities for live/work arrangements. The retail/service options typically include boutique-type establishments, neighborhood restaurants or pubs, and/ or neighborhood-serving services like dentists, daycares, etc., and the places of employment are small offices.","Bicycle and pedestrian connections to adjoining neighborhoods, and buildings oriented to the street are required to ensure the non-residential enhances nearby neighborhoods by creating a truly walkable environment.","Parking should be minimized and where necessary, located internally.",nonres
Medium Density Non-Residential / Mixed-Use,en,MNR MU,596979,"Primarily community-serving commercial uses, services, places of employment, and/or a mix of uses within mid-rise structures with a higher Floor Area Ratio.

Mixed-use structures typically include more multi-family residential units and places of employment, and retail and commercial options generally draw from a larger geographic area. An activated and pedestrian-scale ground level should be provided. These developments may include more employment space for professional office and can include some larger entertainment spaces.","Though they draw more external users, they should still include multi-modal connections allowing for easy neighborhood access. Mass transit infrastructure is to be provided on par with that of other modes, and the higher-density housing types should be located in close proximity.","The buildings should be oriented to the street, and developments should avoid over-parking, with provided parking located internally.",nonres
High Density Non-Residential / Mixed-Use,en,HNR MU,183051,"Primarily regional-serving commercial uses, services, places of employment, and/or a mix of uses within high-rise structures with a high Floor Area Ratio.

Mixed-use structures typically include an abundance of multi-family residential units, places of employment, and entertainment options, and the retail and commercial options generally draw from a regional geographic area. Screening and buffers should be provided to adjoining lower-density residential developments, however those adjoining neighborhoods should retain convenient access to the development.","These developments are generally located along higher intensity roadways. Mass transit infrastructure, on par with that of other modes, should be provided, and bicycle and pedestrian connections to adjoining developments are required. Internal multi-modal connectivity throughout the development is critical.",Parking is generally provided in structures with activated ground levels.,nonres
Industrial and Production Non-Residential / Mixed-Use,en,INR,1CA281,"Primarily employment land dedicated to the most intense types of employment-centric development. This is the only category where uses are inherently incompatible and are best separated from adjacent uses.

These uses are best suited in areas where they already exist, collocating to utilize industrial-scale infrastructure to serve the needs of the users. Environmental protection measures should be taken to minimize impacts.","These uses are also heavy employers and should incorporate mass transit infrastructure, on par with that of other modes, to connect residents to their jobs.",,nonres
