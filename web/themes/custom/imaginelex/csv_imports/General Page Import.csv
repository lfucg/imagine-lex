Why & How,en,"Lexington is a growing, vibrant city – a city with an iconic identity worth preserving, and vast potential to extend that quality of life to newcomers and visitors alike. Imagine Lexington, created after two years of study, deliberation, and public input, creates a path forward for the next 20 years to unlock that potential. This is a plan designed for Lexington by the people of Lexington, and is an ambitious yet attainable vision for the future.

Comprehensive Plans are required by state law for jurisdictions engaging in land use regulations, influencing land use decisions, policy and ordinance changes, as well as community facility development.  Therefore, Imagine Lexington directly impacts the everyday lives of Lexingtonians, touching each of the vital components of the community, and laying out a road map for them to work together.",/why-and-how,why_hero.jpg
"Your City, Your Plan",en,"Over 10,000 contributors from all walks of life participated in the development of Imagine Lexington. A concerted effort was made to involve as many people as possible through new innovative strategies, and the result was an unprecedented response from the community. The philosophy is simple – the more input received, the higher the quality of the end product. Planning staff, Planning Commission, and Council heard from individuals and representatives of community organizations throughout the two-year process, and incorporated the feedback into the plan. The final product is reflective of the broad community interests and though not every individual request could be honored, is a far better plan for the input received.",/your-plan,city_hero.jpg
Plans & Resources,en,"Imagine Lexington is the outcome of over two years of study, deliberation, and public input. Though it is very much its own unique product, it was built with significant support from existing plans and studies that serve to further Lexington’s community vision.

This plan is also the result of a tremendous amount of groundwork by way of outside research, presentations, work sessions, and committee meetings led by Planning staff, the Planning Commission, and the Urban County Council. 

This page provides links to all supporting plans and archived materials relating to the 2018 Comprehensive Plan’s development process.",/resources,resources_hero.jpg
Goals & Objectives,en,"To ensure that the urban growth boundary policies and other long-range planning issues address the expected needs for new urban development and contribute to the prosperity of Lexington-Fayette County, these goals and objectives have been drafted based upon the projected community needs of today with the confidence that they will continue to be reviewed and revised as necessary on the five-year review cycle mandated by state statute. Anytime in the interim, the Planning Commission may recommend that Council amend the Goals and Objectives, and any recommendation shall be presented for consideration, amendment, and adoption by the Council.",/goals,goals_hero.jpg
