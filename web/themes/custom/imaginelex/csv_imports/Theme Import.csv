Growing Successful Neighborhoods,en,A,f36e2b,Design:Density:Equity,Theme A_hero.jpg,Neighborhoods Icon.png,Neighborhoods,/neighborhoods,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjx3_P-x2dQ,"Lexington’s neighborhoods are among the community’s strongest assets.  The historic downtown areas, the traditional suburban single-family neighborhoods, and the more recent mixed-use developments are all part of the landscape.  Historically, Lexington’s neighborhood development has focused on the separation of uses in order to minimize potential conflict.  However, many progressive and developing cities are starting to move past this traditional practice with the implementation of form-based codes, design criteria, and more modern mixed-use zones.  
Recently, walkable, mixed-use neighborhoods are popular among the two fastest-growing age groups in Lexington, young professional-aged residents and senior citizens. Imagine Lexington hopes to reinforce this trend to offer a variety of options to Lexington residents.  Providing these mixed-use and mixed-housing type developments will supplement existing successful neighborhoods throughout Lexington and diversify the housing stock.
","Successful neighborhoods are the building blocks of a desirable community.  Lexington’s neighborhoods, and more importantly the neighbors themselves, make up the foundation of the city.  Creating diversity within these neighborhoods is key to their long-term sustainability and success.  Diversity within housing types, housing affordability, land uses, transportation options, and recreational opportunities is crucial, as is creating welcoming spaces for people of all races, ethnicities, and age groups.

Lexington is undeniably a growing city, and it is important to ensure that this growth results in community.  This continued urbanization needs to be properly managed, and great care should be taken to guarantee existing neighborhoods are enhanced by this growth.  Consciously and carefully directed growth and development will strengthen already successful neighborhoods and create vibrant new ones with a high standard of design and a focus on community-building amenities."
Protecting the Environment,en,B,004b4c,Protection:Sustainability:Restoration,Theme B_hero.jpg,Enivronment Icon.png,Environment,/environment,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhbkCZ_wYh4,"For Lexington to adequately support its natural environment, it is critical to understand the current status of our ecosystem’s fundamental parts and the conditions they face as a consequence of continued growth and development in our community. These fundamental parts, which include water, air, and land, play significantly into our quality of life and are the basis for a healthy ecological network that extends far beyond our county limits.
When thinking of environmental concerns in Lexington, water quality is often the first to come up. In response to this, Lexington has been strategic in its approach to improving water quality in the city and mitigating the past consequences of ignoring impacts of development. Stormwater management is now an integral part of the development process and the LFUCG Division of Water Quality continues to undertake improvements, monitoring, and mitigation. 
Clean air has also been a firm objective in the city’s pursuit to enhance public and environmental health. Close monitoring of local air quality conditions has been a priority of the Lexington Area MPO, who pair these metrics with methods to reduce air pollution, such as alternative forms of transportation.
With regard to land, it is clear that our natural resources are changing with development over time. With the presence of the Urban Service Boundary, the community’s rural land has been largely protected, yet the boundary has placed additional pressure on urban land within. Proper policies to protect our urban environmental network will prevent this land from becoming a fractured system, thus supporting its ability to provide the ecological, economic, and social benefits that we have come to value.","The environment is part of our everyday life. It is the air we breathe, the food we eat, the water we drink, the open spaces where we entertain, and the land on which we live. Undoubtedly, the health of the environment has great impact on health and quality of life. Due to this tremendous influence, Lexington is mounting a growing effort to implement and maintain sustainability practices that will enhance the natural environment that our people fiercely depend on, while also serving to accommodate projected growth.

This theme of Imagine Lexington assesses the impacts of development on the environment, and recommends policies and practices that minimize the negative impacts of land use and development. The policies focus on protecting valuable natural resources, taking a sustainable approach to development activities, and restoring the environment within the urban fabric."
Creating Jobs & Prosperity,en,C,9079b4,Livability:Diversity:Prosperity,Theme C_hero.jpg,Jobs _ Prosperity.png,Jobs & Prosperity,/jobs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5AwNKoglVc,"Agriculture in Lexington accounts for roughly 86% of Fayette County’s rural lands, with more than 50% dedicated to the equine industry; the Ag Cluster contributes approximately $8.5 million to the local tax base. Tourism is seeing an increase with key attractions including the natural beauty of the area, horse farms, equine events and racing, tours, the Bourbon Trail, restaurants, bourbon distilleries, scenic roadways, craft breweries, and more. Employers and industries range from small businesses, which employ 67.7% of Lexington’s workforce, to large entities such as the University of Kentucky, which is the single largest employer in the county.  Revenue to support general operating expenses and the project needs of the city is generated from crucial employment and business taxes; increasing employment in industries with higher paying jobs can have a larger impact on increasing revenues. Workforce characteristics in Fayette County include a high educational attainment and a relatively stable labor force even as the city continues to grow; the need to recruit and retain young professionals will be important to the future.","Lexington has been listed by several national publications as a “top ranked city” in many quality of life categories and is the Horse Capital of the World. Many people choose to live in or visit because of the beautiful greenbelt of farms, horse-related entertainment, the University of Kentucky, Bourbon and Brewgrass Trails, wineries, restaurants, healthcare, schools, and so many other attractions and amenities. Many businesses also choose to locate in Lexington for these same reasons. Imagine Lexington seeks to capitalize on opportunities to build on these existing strengths. As a city with a diverse economy that provides many employment options, leading industries include Healthcare and Social Assistance; Retail Trade and Accommodations and Food Services; and the Wholesale Trade and Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services. Maintaining that diversity in industries and occupations and continuing to recruit employers, especially from industries with higher-paying jobs, will be beneficial to Lexington’s revenue flow and should provide upward mobility opportunities for employees in industries with lesser paying jobs."
Improving a Desirable Community,en,D,c75657,Connectivity:Placemaking:Support,Theme D_hero.jpg,Community Icon.png,Community,/community,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxGgaBhjJpY,"Lexington is continually looking to improve the quality of life for its residents. Many cities do not have the same environmental and natural constraints as Lexington, and feel more empowered to continue the onward march of suburban expansion. Those challenges and constraints lend urgency to the need to be progressive and innovative, and call for leadership and vision by City officials to implement thoughtful solutions. 
Connecting people by creating opportunities for Lexington’s citizens to interact with each other through better transportation infrastructure is a fundamental way to improve the overall community. A great effort has been expended so far to build out a robust trail systems for pedestrians and bicyclists. For example, the Town Branch Commons will serve as an economic engine to attract activity downtown, whether it be individuals or businesses. The dividends are realized through national attention and rankings in various livability categories. That type of economic investment must be continued, expanded, and enhanced to serve all Lexington residents. ","Building a desirable community requires policies to exceed all that Lexington has done so far. It requires raising the bar on both the public and private sector to deliver ever better outcomes. How Lexington chooses to do this is an important statement about the values of the community. The public has made it clear that they want more places and ways to connect with each other. As the global retail economy shifts and spaces are being reconceived, it is vital that Lexington make certain that those community preferences are considered and addressed. With this steady growth, policies must also ensure the economy does not leave lower income residents behind. Lexington’s citizens have also demonstrated that suburban expansion is not something they are interested in, and that Lexington’s natural and environmental resources are too important to consume for just more of the same. That conscious decision has a great impact on the policy needs of the future."
Urban & Rural Balance,en,E,8e4a27,Accountability:Stewardship:Growth,Theme E_hero.jpg,Balance Icon.png,Balance,/balance,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4LmyCjrWBK8,"Lexington’s urban growth is coupled with rural protections that have resulted in a desirable community with a more fiscally responsible development pattern than is typical of other areas throughout the United States. 
The city of Lexington is comprised of 285 square miles, 85 squares miles of which are included in the Urban Service Boundary (USB). Roughly ¼ of the remaining 200 square miles are protected by the Purchase of Development Rights program, which safeguards farmland for food security and conservation of environmentally sensitive lands. 
As of 2017 the U.S. Census estimated that the City of Lexington had a population of 321,959, a figure that has consistently increased over the years. Senior citizens will account for the greatest percentage of Lexington’s projected population increase.
The 2017 Housing Demand Study found a need for ~2,300 new housing units annually over the next 10 years. Infill and redevelopment will continue to be the foremost development strategy for the city. The amount of vacant land available for infill projects is roughly 10% of land within the USB. There are also significant redevelopment opportunities in the underutilized property along the city’s major arterial corridors.","At the heart of every discussion about the future of Lexington is the balance between urban growth and rural protection and preservation. Lexington is a growing city and has agricultural assets worth preserving, but how can both be achieved? The answer is by growing intelligently through compact, fiscally responsible development patterns, the foundation of which was established in this city as the nation’s first urban service boundary.

This pattern of development has numerous benefits, including infrastructure cost savings, desirable placemaking opportunities, multimodal transportation options, enhanced connectivity, healthier communities, vibrant neighborhood-serving businesses, preservation of irreplaceable farmland, and many others as well. Smart growth patterns and rural preservation go hand-in-hand."
